            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Writers both of Nature and Policy agree, That the Original of
all humane Society, was <hi>Marriage,</hi> by which Families were firſt
compoſed, conſiſting of Men, their Wives and Children; and after
Commonwealths compoſed of thoſe Families; when by the multiplication of
Generation they were grown ſo numerous, as to be no longer able to preſerve
their Religion, Liberty, Propriety and Lives, againſt one another, without
ſome Union of all, obnoxious to receive or do Injuries under ſuch Form of
Government as was by the whole, or major part of the Fathers of Families, in
their General Conventions of themſelves or Repreſentatives, Conſented and
Covenanted for the common Peace and Happineſs of all; to both which, no
Conſtitution of Laws was more neceſſary than thoſe which concern'd
<hi>Marriage, Filiation, Aliment</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> whereon not
only private but publick Peace and War often depended; and therefore Marriage
being the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and not of Man, it was impoſsible to lay any
ſecure Foundation of the Rights of the ſame, except on the Moral Law of
God, and no other was long obſerved, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Jews</hi> or
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> than what was as Chriſt ſaith, from the beginning, till
to break in pieces the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Tables of the ſame, the Devil and the Prieſt
conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together to ſet up the Golden Calf of their Ceremonies, 
<pb facs="tcp:49347:3"/>and that Gods Ordinance ſhould be null and void without them, and
no probation ſhould be admitted of their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, but the Certificate of
the Biſhop or High-Prieſt; by which, as to matter of Succeſsion to
Inheritances and Kingdoms, <hi>They bound their Kings with Chains, and their
Nobles with Fetters of Iron;</hi> God was pleaſed to make the Contention
concerning a Marriage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>H. 8.</hi> and the Pope, the occaſion of
breaking off ſome of the Links, and of being a beginning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion and Liberty; and I hope he doth now offer the like, or a greater
occaſion, of propagating both, to the preſent Age and Poſterity, and not
only to break all the Reliques of the Chains, but to file off the Collars
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereby the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Provincial
Biſhops, have long ſo gauled the Necks of Princes and People through all
Chriſtendom; to the eaſing of which Burdens, I ſhould be glad, if thou,
and ſo many other, more fit than my ſelf, would lend your hands; but
ſeeing ſo many ſeeming to ſleep in the midſt of ſo great a danger,
I hope it ought not to offend, if I hereby endeavour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken you, and to be
therein as I ought to be, to my Power,</p>

                     <hi>DEut.</hi> 24.1. It's
ſaid, <hi>When a man hath taken a Wife, and married her, and it come to
paſs that ſhe find no favour in his Eyes, becauſe he hath found ſome
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs in her; then let him write a Bill of Divorcement, and give it
in her hand, and ſend her out of his Houſe. And when ſhe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out
of his Houſe, ſhe may go and be another man</hi>'s <hi>Wife. Her form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Husband which ſent her away, may not take her again, after that ſhe is
defiled, for that is abomination before the Lord.</hi> Math. 5.31. <hi>It hath
been ſaid, Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, let him give her a writing
of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement. But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever ſhall put away his
Wife, ſaving for the cauſe of Fornication, cauſeth her to commit
Adultery, and whoſoever ſhall marry her that is Divorcèd, committeth
Adultery.</hi> Math. 19.3. <hi>The Phariſees alſo came unto him, tempting
him, and ſaying unto him, Is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a man to put away his Wife for
every cauſe? And he anſwered, and ſaid unto them, Have ye not read, that
he which made them at the beginning, made them Male and Female? And ſaid, for
this cauſe ſhall a man leave Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave to his
Wife, and they twain ſhall be one fleſh. Wherefore they are no more twain,
but one fleſh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
aſunder. They ſay unto him, Why did</hi> Moſes <hi>then command to give a
writing of Divorcement, and to put her away? He ſaith unto them,</hi>
Moſes, <hi>becauſe of the hardneſs of your hearts, ſuffer'd you to put
away your Wives, but from the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> Here it is plain,
Chriſt refers them to the Law of Nature, as the Law which was greater then
the Politick, or Poſitive Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And this was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tolerated by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the hardneſs of their hearts; and though
it were lawful for <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any other Legiſlator, to tolerate a
leſſer Evil, which he was not able by reaſon of the hardneſs of their
hearts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49347:7"/>yet was it not lawful for the People
to practiſe it, but they ſhould be puniſhed for it by God, though they
were not by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And hence doth manifeſtly follow, That all
thoſe Laws which were <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of
Nature, which was from the beginning, though To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
who was not able to reform them, yet were they not properly the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> but wicked Cuſtoms, which they received from
<hi>Aegyptians, Syrians, Canaanites,</hi> and other Nations, and ought not to
have been practiſed by the <hi>Jews</hi> then, nor by the Chriſtians now.
Of Laws taken from the Cuſtoms of Idolatrous Nations, for a ſmall taſt
take theſe that follow. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.2. <hi>If thou buy an</hi> Hebrew
<hi>Servant, ſix Years he ſhall Serve, and in the ſeventh he ſhall go
out free for nothing.</hi> Verſe 4. <hi>If his Maſter have given him a
Wife, and ſhe have born him Sons or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; The Wife and her Children
ſhall be her Maſters, and he ſhall go out by himſelf. Mahomet</hi>'s
was more fair then this; for he being Amorous of the Wife of <hi>Zeid</hi> his
Slave, freely infranchiſed him, though he were not bound to do it, as the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Maſter was, and beſides his infranchiſement, gave him
Money for his Wife. And thereupon ſaith, God <hi>appointed him to Marry her,
after ſhe was Repudiated, to the end that true beleivers might do the like,
and not think it an Error, but what God hath appointed.</hi> Alcor. Cap.
33.260. And <hi>David</hi> did far worſe then <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as to the
Wife of the Subject <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> his Example therefore is as unfit a Rule
to judg Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by, as that of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Mahomet. Levit.</hi>
19.20. It is ſaid, <hi>And whoſoever lieth carnally with a Woman that is a
Bond-maid, betrothed to an Husband, and not at all Redeemed, nor Freedom given
her, ſhe ſhall be ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they ſhall not be put to death, becauſe
ſhe was not Free: And he ſhall bring his Trepaſs-Offering unto the Lord,
unto the Door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, even a Ram for a
Treſpaſs-Offering. And the Prieſt ſhall make an Atonement for him with
a Ram of the Treſpaſs-Offering before the Lord; for his ſin which he hath
done ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> 1. This Law is unjuſt, for it puniſheth
the weaker Veſſel, who is a poor Virgin, with ſcourging, and only fines
the rich Lecher, a Ram; ſo he may commit Whoredom with as many betrothed
Virgins, if not Free-women, for the price of a Ram apeice. 2. Here is nothing
provided for ſatisfaction of the Damage of the Maſter, for the abuſe of
his Servant, and diſhonour of his Family, nor of the Husband to whom ſhe
was betrothed; but let him bring a Ram, his ſin ſhall be forgiven him,
<hi>toties quoties,</hi> as 'tis the Cuſtom of ſome old <hi>Pagan</hi>
Manners, and Manours, if the Copyhold Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow be unchaſt, ſhe ſhall
forfeit her Copyhold, unleſs ſhe beſtride a Ram, and ride to the next
Court, and ſay theſe Words following, 
<q>

the skirt of <hi>Boaz;</hi> then the Rabbi takes a glaſs full of Wine and
gives it the Brideman and Bride that they may drink, then he takes the
Bridegroom's Gold Ring, and asks of the ſtanders by, if it be good and worth
the money given for it; then puts it on the Bride's finger; then he takes
another glaſs of Wine and prayes over it, and offers it to the married Couple
to taſt, but the Bridegroom daſhes it againſt the Wall in memory of the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo the Bridegroom in ſign of

in queſtion of Inceſt, 'tis very clear, That <hi>John</hi> juſtly
reproved <hi>Herod</hi> for marrying his Brother's Wife, whether there was a
Judgment followed on it or not. But it cannot be infer'd that the cauſe why
he reproved it, or why the War followed on him was Inceſt; but the cauſe
thereof is more likely to be, becauſe he ſo wrongfully Divorced his firſt
lawful Wife, and likewiſe cauſed his Brother's Wife to be Divorced from
him, while his Brother was alive and Tetrarch of <hi>Galilee,</hi> that he
might have her from him: So here was a double Divorce, matter enough to reprove
without minding any Inceſt; which agreed likewiſe with the Doctrine of
Chriſt, and 'tis manifeſt, that was the only cauſe of the War, and not
any pretence of Inceſt; for <hi>Aretas</hi> would have raiſed the War alike
if the wrong had been done his Daughter by a ſtrange Woman, as if it had been
by a Kinſwoman: Therefore no Argument can be brought that St. <hi>John</hi>'s
opinion was, this was Inceſt, nor that any Judgment happen'd for Inceſt,
but rather for unlawful Divorces; ſo the marrying the Brother's Wife to
raiſe up Seed to the Brother, ſeems a cuſtom tolerated for hardneſs of
their hearts, and not to be imitated by Chriſtians.</p>

In <hi>Loango</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> if any is ſuſpected of Adultery,
Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Theft, or other Crimes, there is a little Tree with a ſmall

Prieſt aſſembles the <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49347:10"/>accuſed Parties, and ſcrapes
a little of the Root into water, which makes it as bitter as Gall. One Root
will ſerve for the Tryal of an hundred, the Prieſt beats it together with a
Plantan ſtalk, and hits every one after they have drunk, with certain words:
If they can walk by till they make Urine, they are free, but if they grow
dizzy, they are knock'd oth' head, and dragg'd thence when dead. The
<hi>Matimbas</hi> have the ſame Tryal of Adultery and other Crimes, with the
ſame Root made into bitter water; the nature whereof is, if it be given in
too great a Doſe, it ſtops the Urine, and flies up into the head, whereby
the Party becomes dizzy, which if he be, here the Execution ſomething differs
from the former, and all the People preſently fall upon them, and cut them in
peices with Knives. At <hi>Morumbay</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> if any is
ſuſpected to be guilty of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, or any Crime, there is an Idol in a

when accuſed, and each to kneel down, and ſay, <hi>Mene queſa Cabumba

<hi>Enchion Kenow,</hi> which the Inhabitants beleive hath ſuch a force and

ſuſpected of Adultery by her Husband, and brought to drink thereof for
Trial, if ſhe be Guilty, the <hi>Fetiſſo</hi> will kill her, which makes
the Woman accuſed, if Guilty, rather compound, and aſſent to be Divorced

                     <p>The <hi>Americans</hi> for the moſt part, if they find not
their Wives Virgins, or if after, they commit Adultery, Divorce them, wherein
they far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel theſe ſhameleſs and deviliſh Trials of <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Ordeal, and Fire-Ordeal, heretofore
uſed by Chriſtians, of walking over Red hot Plow-ſhares bare foot, or the
newer faſhion of putting Women to Self-accuſation, Canonical Purgation, and
Compurgation in Epiſcopal Courts. Likewiſe amongſt Chriſtians I ſay,
this ſimple plain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of private Divorce, both amongſt the
<hi>Guineans</hi> and <hi>Americans,</hi> by the light of Nature, far excels
all the ſaid Tryals by <hi>Jewiſh, Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Prieſts. Laſtly, It is clear from Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> diſallowing the
Bill of Divorce by the Husband, except for Fornication, and his allowing it by
the Husband, when there was Adultery. He diſallows the Laws of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of
Virginity, and Tryal of Jealouſie, as well as he diſallowed the Bill of
Divorce, without lawful cauſe. For the Tryal of Virginity and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie is
far worſe, and ſhews greater hardneſs of heart, then the Bill of Divorce,
in regard the Bill of Divorce, if the Husband find any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs or
diſhoneſty in his Wife, only puts her away, and ſaves both her Honour and
Life; but the Tryal of Virginity and Jealouſie, permits the man firſt to
lie with her, and perhaps to get her with Child, and then to <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49347:10"/>ſtone her, or with bitter water to poiſon her, and her Child
together, wherein the <hi>Turk</hi> is not ſo bad as the <hi>Jew.</hi> For
though he buy his Wife, if after he finds her not as ſhe ſhould be, he will
Divorce her, and though he loſe his Money by it, he will neither Stone nor
Poiſon her, but give a Divorce, and ſave both her Life and Honour. The
<hi>Peguians</hi> buy their Wives of their Friends, and when he is weary of
her, he may ſend her home again, but he muſt then loſe the Money he gave
for her. But it ſhe leave him, as ſhe may likewiſe do, then the Money is
to be paid him back, which he gave for her.</p>

a recompence, They are bound to maintain their Mother, and marry their
Siſters, that they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may be provided for, out of their Father's

                  <p>The Epigram of <hi>Beza</hi> is neat, but the Author ſeems
to be much of the <hi>French</hi> woman's mind, mention'd by
<hi>Montaigne;</hi> who alledged her ſelf to be Raviſh'd by force, but
after often rejoyced, and thank't God ſhe had once in her life ſo much
pleaſure without ſin. Whereas <hi>Tamar,</hi> who was truly Raviſh'd by

Aſhes on her Head, and rent her Garment of divers colours, and laid her hand
on her head, and went on Crying.</hi> Why doth not <hi>Beza</hi> tax
<hi>Tamar</hi> in the ſame degree, for ſpoiling her fine Cloths, and
blubbering her Face, as he doth <hi>Lucretia,</hi> who being a Wife, was more
concern'd in the double, perhaps treble honour of her ſelf, her Husband and
Children, then a Virgin in her's, which is only ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; and therefore to
clear all ſuſpicion, thought it neceſſary to give ſo high a
Teſtimony of her Innocence as ſhe did?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> in the like caſe commends divers noble
Virgins, who kill'd themſelves to preſerve their honour. The like did the
Women of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> under <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> and other
<hi>Antiochian</hi> Women under <hi>Choſroe</hi> the <hi>Perſian.</hi> The

Many Virgins there were in the Primitive times, who drowned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in

Virgins, who ſlew themſelves for the ſame cauſe; and are all generally
Recorded in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories for Martyrs. Yet St.

down their lives to avoid the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour: and cannot but be ſtruck with
admiration of ſo Divine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in ſo weak a Sex, as made them greater
in valour than Men; in love of their Husbands, than Women; in fame, than
Angels: To whom, though Chriſt gives ſo high a degree of Chaſtity, as
neither to marry or give in marriage; yet could not they avoid being ſpotted
by ſlanderous Tongues, to be like the Heathen Gods, lovers of Women; whereas
fame <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49347:14"/>it ſelf, dared not belye theſe Heroick Ladies, who
defended their Honour with their Blood. But to draw to an end of this Section,
There appear amongſt the nations many good, many indifferent, and many moſt

                  <p>As Deſertions and Divorces of Mothers without cauſe, have
been too frequent both amongſt <hi>Gentiles, Jews,</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſo likewiſe is the Deſertion, and not giving
Aliment to Children. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſtain'd his Philoſophy with the
bloody Doctrine of expoſing Infants. The <hi>Chinoys,</hi> who are poor,
think it Charity to ſtrangle their Infants, and ſave their Aliment.
Fornicators make it their cuſtom to deflour Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and get them with
Child, and then illegitimate and deſert both Mother and Child to ſave the
charge of Aliment: And oh horrid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians! whole Pariſhes
riſe with Swords and Staves againſt one poor Sucking Babe, to exterminate
both it, and the Mother naked, and to be Vagabonds to beg, ſteal, or
ſtarve, only to ſave ſo ſmall an Alms as Aliment to one poor Infant,
not able to ſpeak or beg for it ſelf. It is related by Travellers, that
ſome <hi>Indians</hi> uſe, when a Child is born, if it take not to ſuck
the Dug of the Mother well, they carry it out of the Houſe and hang it naked
on a Tree, and leave it there, returning themſelves into the Houſe: after a
while they go out again, and bring in the Child and offer it the Teat; if it
take it not, they carry it the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and let it hang twice as long,
and fetch and offer it the Teat again; if it take it not then, they hang it on
the Tree the third time, and leave it hanging till it dies. God made man
righteous and writ the Moral Law in his heart, but ſince the Devil hath
ſeduced him to the Ceremonial, he is become worſe then a Beaſt.</p>

wrote many Books concerning the ſame, yet did always very much abhor the
Papal Canons, and writes in interpretation <hi>l. quoties C. de Jud.</hi> that
the Canoniſts made all their Laws according to their own Arbitrary will, and
obſerved the Civil Law only for their profit, and not when it made againſt
them, out of Ambition to uſurp Temporal Juriſdiction to themſelves, and
to no other end. The Canon Law is deſervedly likewiſe cenſured, by the

concludes in theſe words, <hi>Thus much</hi> (and may be too much) <hi>for

without and againſt reaſon, to be</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Vicar, and
Infallible; or any Book which hath more Seditious and Rebellious principles of
Diſloyalty. This I only ſay now, but when I have what I now want, time and

(and when believed and practiſed) how pernitious to Kings and Princes, the
principles of that Law are.</hi> I hope all Biſhops will hereafter be of the
ſame mind, and not own the Canon Law to be the Rule of Marriages, and
Legitimations, or Succeſſions of Proteſtant Kings, and Princes, or their
Subjects; or for their Pardons and Excommunications, or fit to be any longer

cuſtoms, which he as well as the Pope, and many other Legiſlators (to
inſnare the conſciences of the Ignorant &amp; Superſtitious)
counterfeited to come from God: in which, though each of the Perſons are
equally guilty of Blaſphemy, yet as to the Laws, the <hi>Mahometan</hi> far
excel the Pontificial. And pardon me if I think our own Municipal Laws derived
from ſo impure a Legiſlator as <hi>Rome.</hi> For firſt here is in
theſe <hi>Arabic</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, no Diſpenſation of what is truly
Inceſt by the Law of Nature, nor any prohibition of any within the fourth
degree, not prohibited by the Law of God or Nature. 2. Here is no prohibition
of <hi>Septuageſima, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,</hi> or <hi>Rogation</hi> times, to get money
for Licenſes to marry. 3. Here is no Banes, carrying of Women to Temples,
buying of the Prieſts Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, nor money given for Licenſes to marry
without them. 4. Here is no inſlaving Women by marriage, unleſs ſlaves
whom they buy in the Market for money, or take Captive in Wars, by Robbing them
of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their Goods; nor any ridiculous and unjuſt puniſhment
of the Man for the Woman, or the Woman for the Man's offences. 5. Here is no
letting Stews, or Fornication to Rent. 6. Here the Father hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to
acknowledge his own Children, and the Children their Father; and no Certificate
of Biſhops hath power to take that right from them. 7. Here the wantonneſs
of Widows is forbidden, who are for new Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands as ſoon as the old is put
in his Grave, whereby who are Fathers of their Children is made uncertain. 8.
Here is no falſe Fathering of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on thoſe who are within four Seas.
9. Here is no puniſhing Men twice for one offence; once by the Temporal
Court, and then by the Spiritual Court: or contrary puniſhments by contrary
Courts; one by the Contentious Court, and another by the Penitential Court. 10.
Here is no Auricular Confeſſion of their Wives or Daughters by Prieſts in

by his Commiſſion or Writ Eccleſiaſtical, Judges to determin and judg
thoſe great and important Cauſes of Matrimony, Divorce, and general
Baſtardy, by Certificate of the Biſhop, who is the Eccleſiaſtical
Witneſs, and Judg both of Fact and Law, and by the Canon Laws, which by uſe
and cuſtom are now our Eccleſiaſtical Laws: Then he is diſabled to be

not then cauſe Juſtice to be adminiſtred to his Subjects in theſe ſo
great and important cauſes of Matrimony, Divorce, and general Baſtardy, on
which depends the ſtrength of mens Deſcents, and Inheritances. This I
conceive, though not in the ſame words, yet in ſence and ſubſtance, to
be the weight of my Lord <hi>Coke's</hi> Argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would make uſe

not ſo expreſs'd in the form of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy:</hi>
For though, <hi>Regum timendorum in proprios greges,</hi>

think he doth not intend it to be above the Law of the Land, ſeeing the King
himſelf by his Oath, is pleaſed to oblige himſelf to his People to govern

the pretended want of Power of doing Juſtice, concerning cauſes of
<hi>Free-hold</hi> and <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> depending on marriage, except by
Eccleſiaſtical Laws and Judges, that is very ſtrange; for how was
Juſtice done in the times of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49347:24"/>Chriſtianity
for many Hundred Years after Chriſt, when neither Biſhops or any other
Eccleſiaſtical Judges, ever pretended Juriſdiction tode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin Temporal
Right or Propriety, but left the ſame to be judged by the Imperial Laws. How
was Juſtice done in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> when the
Juriſdiction of all Matrimonial cauſes remained in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Courts?
<hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Firſt,</hi> his Son, being the firſt, as
<hi>Matthew Paris</hi> writes, whom the Clergy got by his publick Edict to give
the Juriſdiction of Power and Gifts, by reaſon of Marriage, and of all
Matrimonial cauſes to the Biſhops Courts; and the ſame <hi>Richard</hi>
likewiſe gave them Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of all breach of Faith, Promiſes and
Oaths, whereby if much of the Power ſo raſhly granted, had not been by him
ſo ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, they had hookt to themſelves the whole
Juriſdiction from the King's Courts, of all Contracts and Conveyances, Bonds
and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as Marriages, concerning Temporal Goods and
Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And why cannot general as well as ſpecial Baſtardy be tryed
at Common Law? And how likewiſe are all Rights depending on all Marriages
made during the late Civil Wars by pretence of any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament
made by 12. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. to be tryed by a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the
Common Law, and not by Certificate of the Biſhop, or any Eccleſiaſtical

expedition and advantage to the ſame would it be, if by the like Act the
Juriſdiction of all Marriages and Legitimations, as it was in the time of

Six Years, Three Months, and Fourteen Days, during all which time there was no
Church open for Marriages or Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, but the poorer People were buried like

<hi>John</hi> was driven to ſuch diſtreſs by his own Biſhops and

was forced, before he could get to be releaſed of this Excommunication, to
pay the Pope vaſt Sums of Money, and to lay down his Crown, and Scepter,

gather'd a great Army to have been revenged on the <hi>French</hi> King, the
Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> told him 'twas againſt his Oath at his
Abſolution, and the King in a great paſſion reply'd, He would not defer

Power of Lay-judments, as well in Marriages, as they did of ſhutting up of
Churches, in which they were made from the Pope, to whom they had inforced King
<hi>John</hi> to ſurrender his Crown, and not from the King's Writ as that

not anſwer to it, becauſe it was directly againſt the common Order of the
Church, (that is meant the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.) And all the Biſhops

Matrimony, as to the ſucceſſion of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, for ſo much as the

and the Common Law, to judg the Fact of it by any other Judges then Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the Law of it by any other Judges then thoſe of Temporal Courts; and
though the Pope and Biſhops in thoſe Superſtitious times forced the Kings
many times, as they did King <hi>John,</hi> to yeild his Crown, and the
Subjects to yeild their Marriages and other Temporal Rights to their Arbitrary
and Saleable Sentence, for fear of Excommunication; yet doth not this any way
prove that the Juriſdiction of Marriage was ever granted them by any Law or
Act of Parliament, or could be, without it were contrary to a known Common Law
and Act of Parliament, which expreſsly gave the trial of Temporal Rights and
Inheritances to a <hi>Legale Judicium parium,</hi> and not to any
Eccleſiaſtical Judges or Laws. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it being clear they had no
Juriſdiction but by Uſurpation of ſo Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral a Right as Marriage before
this Statute, let any who thinks he can ſee Nine Miles into a Milſtone,
once more look into the Statute of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton</hi> before recited, and try
whether he can ſcrew out of it any word giving the Biſhops either a
Juriſdiction of Marriage, or general Baſtardy, or that this Statute ever
forged ſo rude a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Tool as the two edged Sword of general and
ſpecial Baſtardy, to divide the living Child, or tear it in peices between
the Biſhop and the Temporal Judg; or how it was then conſiſtent with a
<hi>Legale Judicium parium,</hi> to expoſe a Child, no Alien, but the King's
Native Subject, to be tried for all he had, by a then Foraign
Eccleſiaſtical Law, and a Judg a ſworn Canonical Subject to a Foraign
Pope; or that the wiſdom of that Parliament intended to coin a
<hi>Chimera</hi> of a Diſtinction, without a difference of general and
ſpecial Baſtardy, which neither they themſelves underſtood, nor any
Lawyers which write to this day, give any ſenſibly Interpretation, or agree
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves concerning it; or that they who made the Statute to
oppoſe the Biſhops Juriſdiction of Marriage ſhould create a Notion of
general Baſtardy, which <hi>le Scrope</hi> ſays, was not in
<hi>Eſſe</hi> before to give them a new Juriſdiction; which was to change
the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which they poſitively refuſe in the Statute

                  </p>
                  <p>To which is anſwer'd, That there is no ſimilitude between
making or changing the Laws of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> which were Foraign Laws,
to become the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the making or changing either
the Foraign, Papal, or native Provincial Canons, or Eccleſiaſtical Laws,

                  </p>
                  <p>For Firſt, The <hi>Athenian</hi> Laws before they were made
<hi>Denizons</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> were not admitted <hi>in cumulo,</hi> but
Articulated, and every Article examined one by one, by the <hi>Decem viri,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, Such <hi>Athenian</hi> Laws as were pickt or garbled

the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, to be underſtood by the People before they would
be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; but there is no ſuch thing in the
Eccleſiaſtical Laws of the Holy-Church concerning Marriage, or any thing
elſe, but they all ſtill remain in the Language of the Beaſt, and can be
neither call'd the Laws of the Church, which by the Scripture are forbidden to
be ſpoke in an unknown tongue, as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.19. It is
ſaid, <hi>In the Church I had rather ſpeak five words with my
underſtanding, that by my voice I might teach others alſo, then ten
thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</hi> It is as utterly unlawful therefore
to make that a Law of the Church, or an Eccleſiaſtical Law of Marriage,
which is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Language of <hi>Latin,</hi> as it had been to have
made any form of Prayer taken from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, though the
<hi>Pater Noſter</hi> it ſelf, the form of Prayer of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> while it was in <hi>Latin;</hi> for the Miniſter

the <hi>Romans</hi> by Conqueſt of their Bodies by the Temporal Sword, or
their Souls by the Spiritual Sword of Excommunication; but the
Eccleſiaſtical Laws of Marriage have been obtruded on <hi>England,</hi>
ever ſince the Conqueſt by the ſuperſtitious Terrors, or actual force
of Excommunication, either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal or Epiſcopal, and never by conſent in

nor an abuſe againſt Law, an Uſe, Cuſtom, or Law; neither can a wicked
Oppreſſion, Uſe, Cuſtom, or Law, in name only, be turned into a Law of
<hi>England;</hi> except by conſent in Parliament, or other humane Power:
beſides, it is by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before recited Statute of <hi>Merton</hi>
declared, That the Laws of the Church are not the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> for
when the Biſhop; quarrel'd, that the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as to Marriage,
was not according to the Law of the Church, and would have had them changed
into the Law of the Church; the Earls and Barons with one voice anſwer'd, We
will not change the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> Whereby it's plain the Laws of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and Laws of the Church are oppoſite Laws, and not the
ſame, and this is confeſſed by <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf in the
expoſition of his Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> 2 <hi>part Inſt. fol.</hi>
98. where he ſaith, Here our Common Laws are aptly and properly called the
Laws of <hi>England;</hi> becauſe they are appropriated to this Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> as moſt apt and fit for the Government thereof, and have no
dependence upon any Foraign Law whatſoever; no not on the Civil or Canon Law,
other then in Caſes allowed by the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore he
ſaith, the Poet ſpake truly hereof, <hi>Et penitus toto diviſos orbe</hi>
Britannos: So as the Law of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>proprium quarto modo</hi>
to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> therefore Foraign Precedents are not to be
objected againſt us; becauſe we are not ſubject to Foraign Laws. Again,
that cuſtom or uſe of Civil or Canon-Laws or Precedents, doth not make
Civil or Canon-Law the Law of <hi>England,</hi> appears by the uſe of
Sentences of Philoſophers, and Poets, and Precedents of Hiſtorians, all as
much uſed in Courts of Records, of Courts of Judicature, as the Civil or
Canon-Law, yet doth not this uſe or cuſtom make theſe Sentences of
Philoſophy and Poets, and the like, to be the Law of <hi>England,</hi> or

Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>It was in moſt ſtrong Terms judged,
by a Decree in the Court of</hi> Paris <hi>in the Caſe of</hi> Philip <hi>the
Second the</hi> French <hi>King, That be was not bound unto the cuſtoms of
the Civil Law at ſuch time, as they who were next kindred would have redeemed
of him the Countrey of</hi> Guyens; howbeit that many both think, and write,
the Prince to be bound to that Law; for that they think that Law to be Common
to all Nations, and not Common to any City. And yet than the which Law, the
<hi>Romans</hi> themſelves in ſome Caſes thought nothing more
unreaſonable. But our Anceſtors would not have, even our Subjects bound to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; as we ſee in the Ancient Records, that
<hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> erecting the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi>
and <hi>Mompelier,</hi> declared, That they ſhould not be bound unto the
<hi>Roman</hi> Laws. And in the erection of Univerſities, the Kings have
always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That their purpoſe was to have the Civil and Canon Laws in
them publickly profeſſed, and taught to make uſe thereof at their
diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but not that the Subjects ſhould be any way bound thereto,
leſt they ſhould ſeem to derogate from the Laws of their own Countrey, by
advancing the Laws of ſtrangers. And for the ſame cauſe <hi>Alaricus</hi>
King of the <hi>Goths</hi> forbad, upon pain of death, any Man to alledge the
<hi>Roman</hi> Laws, contrary to his Decrees and Ordinances, which M.
<hi>Charles du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> (my Companion, and Ornament of all Lawyers)
miſtaking, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with him very angry, and in reproach calleth him
therefore <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:</hi> howbeit that nothing was therein by
<hi>Alaricus</hi> decreed or done, but that which every wiſe Prince would of
good right have decreed and done: For Subjects will ſo long both remember,
and hope for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Strangers, as they are Govern'd by their Laws.
The like Edict there is of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Fair,</hi> and an old
Decree of the Court of <hi>Paris,</hi> whereby we are expreſly forbidden to
alledge the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> againſt the Laws and Cuſtoms of
our Anceſtors. Yea the King of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo hath, upon Capital pain,
forbidden any Man to alledge the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws in confirmation of their
own Laws, (as <hi>Oldrad</hi> writeth.) <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49347:27"/>And albeit there
was nothing in the Laws and Cuſtoms of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which differ'd from
the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; yet ſuch is the force of that Edict, that all men
may underſtand, that the Judges in deciding of the Subjects Cauſes, were
not bound unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws: And therefore much leſs the Prince
himſelf, who thought it a thing dangerous, to have his Subjects bound unto
ſtrange Laws. And worthy he is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Traitor, that dares to
oppoſe ſtrange Laws, and ſtrange Decrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Laws of his own
Prince. In which doings, when the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> did too much offend,
<hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> forbad the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws to be at
all taught in <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Polycrates</hi> writeth: Which was more
ſtraightly provided for by King <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the <hi>Tenth,</hi> who
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Magiſtrates and Judges to come unto the Prince himſelf, and
as often as there was nothing written in the Laws of their Country con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matter in Queſtion. Wherein <hi>Baldus</hi> is miſtaken, when he
writeth the <hi>Italians</hi> to be bound to the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws; but the
<hi>French</hi> no otherwiſe than ſo far, as they ſhould ſeem unto them
to agree with Equity and Reaſon. For the one is as little bound as the other;
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> the Countries of <hi>Province, Savoy,
Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Lyonnois,</hi> uſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws more then
other People: And that <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Barbaroſſa</hi> the Emperour,
cauſed the Books of the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws to be publiſhed and taught: the

have granted prohibitions, when they tranſcended the bounds of their
Juriſdictions, and that <hi>Reges ſacro oleo uncti, ſunt ſpiritualis
Juriſdictionis capaces,</hi> but ſtill this is <hi>nihil ad rhombum,</hi>
nor pertinent to make good the Name or Title he hath ſet his Book of the
King's Eccleſiaſtical Laws: For there is a great difference, if he had
Entitled it <hi>de juriſdictione Regis Eccleſiaſtica;</hi> for the King's
Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and the King's Laws are clean divers things. And there is a
great difference where he grants Juriſdiction to Eccleſiaſtical
Perſons, and where he grants them by what Laws they ſhall exerciſe that
Juriſdiction; for the King's of <hi>England</hi> have Anciently granted
Juriſdiction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to Eccleſiaſtical perſons, as
Biſhops and Prieſts, to be Judges in the <hi>King's-Bench, Chancery,</hi>
and other Courts, yet could they not grant them power to judge by any other
Laws than the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> except by Act of Parliament. Then as to
granting prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, where the King had not, or could not by Law grant them
Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, proves nothing that any King did, or could by Law, grant them
Juriſdiction of general Baſtardy, without Act of Parliament; or that there
was any Law or Act of Parliament, which gave them Juriſdiction of general
Baſtardy, becauſe the King's Courts durſt not grant prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for
general Baſtardy. For in thoſe ſuperſtitious times, neither the King
nor Judges dar'd provoke their Excommunication, and therefore at the making of
the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> when the conteſt was between the
Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Power, which of them ſhould give the Law to
Marriage: The Temporal Judges for fear of their Excommunication, took only,
like the <hi>Jackal,</hi> what the <hi>Lion</hi> refuſed, and left them,
which <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49347:28"/>they called ſpecial Baſtardy. So, <hi>quod non

Chriſt; for the true Chriſt took nothing from it, but paid tribute to it.

two pretious Stones, or Cryſtals, which he called the ſeeing Stones, given
him by Spirits, whom he believed to be good Angels. And <hi>Edward Kelly</hi>
had the gift of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Apparitions made in thoſe Cryſtals or
pretious Stones, and of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and interpreting whatſoever ſeem'd to be
written in them. After long converſe by Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> with theſe
Spirits, and a multitude of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions repreſented, and ſome

                        <p>Hereupon we were in great amazement, and greif of mind,
that ſo impure a Doctrine ſhould proceed from ſuch, as I, from the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and hitherto had judged, and undoubtedly eſteemed good Angels,
and had unto <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> offer'd my Soul as a pawn to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifie
<hi>Edward Kellys</hi> crediting of them, as the good and faithful Miniſters
of Almighty God. But now my heart was ſore afflicted on many cauſes, and
Mr. <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> had as he now thought he had, a juſt cauſe of
leaving dealing with them any more; and his Prayer to God had been as he ſaid
of a long time, that he might have power to do it. Afterward I made ſome
Declaration to our Wives of this our great greif, by reaſon of the Command
laid upon us, to uſe Matrimonial Acts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us four in common, which thing
was ſtrange to the Women, and they hoped of ſome more comfortable iſſue
of the matter, and ſo for that time I left off.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>After <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> had been four hours in ſeeing
new Apparitions, giving him admonition to receive the ſame Doctrine, with
threatning of Judgment upon us, if we ſhould not; and many other things told
me. We departed each to Bed, where I found my Wife awake, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear
ſome new matter of me. And we being alone, I then told her, and ſaid,
<hi>Jane</hi> I ſee there is no other remedy but as hath been ſaid, of our
croſs Matching, ſo it muſt needs be done. Thereupon ſhe fell a weeping
and trembling for a quarter of an hour, and I pacified her as well as I could,
and ſo in the fear of God, and beleiving of his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, did
perſuade her, that ſhe ſhewed her ſelf prettily reſolved to be
content for God's ſake, and his ſecret purpoſes, to obey the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
admoniſhment But <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> who had divers other Apparitions made
to him in his own Chamber, remained notwithſtanding in his purpoſe of
forſaking, and utterly diſcrediting theſe Creatures.</p>
                     <p>A Spirit calling himſelf <hi>Raphael</hi> the Arch-Angel,

                        <hi>April</hi> 22th. 1587. <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> having on

Matrimony, makes a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in writing that he would from that forward no
farther meddle therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>April</hi> 24th. There are further Prayers made to God,
deſiring a further manifeſtation of his pleaſure concerning this new
Doctrine ſo contrary to the Laws formerly promulgated by him.</p>
                     <p>A great flame of Fire appeareth in the principal ſtone

ſeemeth to come into the South Window of the Chappel, right againſt
<hi>Edward Kelly</hi> (but before that, the ſtone was heaved up an handful
high, and ſet down again well) which thing <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> did think
ſignified ſome ſtrange matter toward. Then after, the man, who came in at
the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſeem'd to have his nether parts in a Cloud, and with ſpread
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad Arms to come towards <hi>Edward Kelly,</hi> at which ſight he
ſhrunk back ſomewhat, and then that Creature took up between both his hands
the principal ſtone and frame of Gold, and mounted up away as he came,
<hi>Edward Kelly</hi> catch'd at it, but could not touch it, at which thing
ſo taken and carried away, and at the ſight thereof <hi>Edward Kelly</hi>
was in great fear and trembling, but Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> was glad and well
pleaſed. A Fire next appears in the leſſer ſtone, left behind on the
Table, and a man in the fire with flaxen hair hanging down on him, being naked
to the Paps, with ſpots of blood upon him, and in the ſhape of
Chriſt.</p>

Soul lived amongſt you. But the Law and tidings of Gladneſs in Mankind, are
both grounded in me. I am the beginning and the end, behold I was even my
ſelf the figure of Miſery and Death for your Sins, why therefore diſdain
you to be figured after me? And as I have made you the figure of two People to
come, ſo have I likewiſe ſanctified you in an holy Ordinance, giving you
the firſt-fruits of the time to come, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my ſelf; I teach you
nothing, for this Commandment is not to be given to Mortal men, but is given to
you to manifeſt your Faith. I <pb n="49" facs="tcp:49347:32"/>I am the firſt and the
laſt, and I will be Shepherd overall, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of my Father may
come, and that my Spirit may be on all fleſh, where there ſhall be no Law,

accept it in that form of words it was written; and to that end Dr.
<hi>Dee</hi> with <hi>Edward Kelly,</hi> went to the Chappel to the South

ſaw two as high as my Son <hi>Arthur,</hi> fighting with Swords by the

Yea that you can: In what is it ſaid I? Then ſaid he, I ſent a thing to

was wounded in the Thigh, and it ſeem'd to bleed, afterward he that was
wounded did bring a yellow ſquare thing out of his boſom, then I
gueſſed it to be my ſtone which was carried away, as is mention'd before;
ſuddenly he ſeem'd to have been out of ſight, and to be come again, he
threatned the other that had wounded him, and ſaid, He would be even with
him, he asked whether he had lain it under the right Pillow; at length they
both went one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other into a little Willow-Tree-Body, on the
right-hand next the new Stairs into the Garden, the Tree ſeem'd to cleave or
open, and they to go in.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon we went away, and I coming to my Chamber found my
Wife lying on her Bed, where I lay yeſternight, and there I lifted up the
right Pillow on which ſhe lay, and there I found my pretious ſtone that was
before taken away by <hi>Madimi,</hi> whereat <hi>Edward Kelly</hi> greatly
wondred, and doubted the verity of the ſhew, but I and my Wife rejoiced,
thanking God.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>So hence none doubts to conclude, that the Spirits which

Chriſt were Devils transformed, and neither good Angels nor Chriſt,
becauſe they tempted to Adultery and Uncleanneſs.</p>

think it a meritorious work, to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute their Wives to their

<hi>Leo Afer,</hi> who was that Countrey-man, tells a ſtory of one of theſe
holy Prophets, who came to a Town, and eſpying a handſom Woman, being a
perſon of very good quality and great eſteem in the Town; yet the Prophet
took her being at a Bath, and lay with her openly in the concourſe of a great
multitude of people, who applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Fact as a great honour to the Lady; and
many of them ran to congratulate her Husband, how happy he was to have ſo
holy a Man part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with him in his Wife: and when ſome of the better ſort
of people, whoſe diſcretion was a degree above the common ſuperſtition
of their Religion, went and informed the Magiſtrates of the Town, of the foul
and ſhameful act was committed by a Vagabond Prophet, and they ſent their
officers to apprehend him; the people roſe upon them, and would have knockt
out the Brains both of Officers and Magiſtrates, had they not ſpeedily
deſiſted. <hi>Carpenter</hi> reporteth from a Monk of <hi>Doway,</hi> That

Prieſt's fees.</note>Concerning which, <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes, That
Virgins were to be brought, before they were married, to the Temple of the
<hi>Babylonian Venus,</hi> and were there placed, Crown'd with Garlands, and
ſate ſeparate from one another by little ſtrings, and never ſtir'd from
thence till ſome ſtranger came in, and giving them money, took them out and
lay with them: And till they had ſo done, they could not be married. Here was
the Original of carrying Virgins to the Temples to be married, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
they received for their proſtitution of themſelves, went to their Prieſts
Treaſury in their <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were likewiſe bound to
proſtitute their Daughters in the Temple of the Goddeſs <hi>Anethis,</hi>
where Virgins, were bound to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute themſelves, and the gains went to
the Prieſts.</p>
                     <p>The Temples of <hi>Biſnagar</hi> have large Revenues,
which are increaſed by the Devotion of Women, who proſtitute themſelve to
gain, for their Idols, which Gain goes to the Prieſts, as did the Gains of
all the Whoriſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries.</p>
                     <p>And many other Temples there were, too many to be repeated;
and ſcarce any Nation, who had Temples, was free from this wicked way, of
making gains by the Prieſts. Thus much therefore, as a touch only, of the
gains of the old <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts: but as to
the new <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh</hi> and Popiſh, they make far greater; for by this
Law, being the Root from which ſo many other prohibitory Laws of the Pope's
multiply, it being almoſt endleſs to repeat all the Taxes, Exciſes, and
Cuſtoms he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of his Temples, Spiritual-Courts, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stews;

<hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth ſet up in <hi>Rome</hi> ſo many Stews of both

'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, as on penal Bonds ſued at Common Law, the party
injuried is repell'd from any Plea of Equity, either that he paid the Money and

or that he received an acquittance, but it was ſince burnt by fire, or he
hath ſince by any other caſualty loſt it, and forces him to a coſtly,
tedious, and ſometimes inextricable Suit for releif in the Chancery, whereby
the remedy, unleſs for a very great Sum, becomes worſe then the
diſeaſe. All which Pleas of Equity, and others of the like nature, might
have been far better determin'd in the ſame Court of Common-Law, as is
excellently well done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by admitting thoſe Pleas of
Equity in the ſame Court, and on proof of them, reſtricting the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of
the Bond to principal Intereſt, Coſt and Damage. But here the Birth-right
of the Subject, wherein not only all his Bonds, but Lands and Goods are
concern'd, is put to a tedious Circuit in the Chancery of Suite and
Proclamations, and after that again, to another Circuit of Action in the
Spiritual Court, and then again to a third Circuit to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law, of
Prohibitions, and then again to a fourth Circuit back to the Spiritual Court by

ſought nothing elſe in their making Marriage a Sacrament,<note place="margin">Sacrament of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> but a lurking hole for their
Abominations; for as ſoon as they got that grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they drew to
themſelves the juriſdiction of all Matrimonial Cauſes, pretending
forſooth that Spiritual things were not to be handled before 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49347:41"/>profane Judges. Next they fell to making of Laws to confirm
their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, in part manifeſtly impious towards God, and partly moſt
injuſt as to Men: Such as are theſe, That Contracts of Marriage between
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors (for this is to be intended of verbal Contracts only) ſhould be firm
and valid, without aſſent of Parents; That Marriages contracted between
Couſins to the Seventh degree, ſhould be unlawful, and if any were
Contracted ſhould be diſſolved, and they likewiſe feigned Degrees,
contrary to the Law of Nations, and Policy of <hi>Moſes,</hi> That it
ſhould not be lawful for a Man who Divorceth his Wife for Adultery to marry
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That Spiritual Kindred ſhould not marry. That it ſhould not be
lawful to marry from <hi>Septuageſima</hi> to the <hi>Octaves</hi> of
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> and three Weeks before the Nativity of <hi>John

of their filthy mire, in which my Feet have ſtuck longer then my mind could
well-brook, yet I hope to have got to my ſelf ſo much good, as that I have
in ſome part pull'd the Lion's skin from theſe Aſſes. The making
Marriage a Sacrament came from the old Pagan Prieſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
perſuaded the people to draw the gains of Sacrifice and Sacraments to
themſelves, that no Marriage could be happy unleſs they were Contracted by
the Prieſts, with Sacrifices to the Gods, and <hi>Sacramenta ignis &amp;
aquae:</hi> for which reaſon the Prieſt ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them with his Holy
Water of this Sacrament, and made them touch Water and Fire, provided by the
Prieſt to that purpoſe; and if any of theſe Ceremonies were omitted,
whereby the Preiſt loſt his gain, then were the Marriage called <hi>nuptiae
innuptiae,</hi> or in the Pope's Canonical Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>null</hi> and
<hi>void.</hi> That Marriage is a Sacrament, the Biſhops and common Lawyers
deny in Words, but acknowledg and confeſs in their Works; for the Biſhops
continue ſtill to uſurp the ſame Juriſdiction of Marriage, which the
Popiſh Biſhops never pretended to, but as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and the Common
Lawyers continue ſtill the myſtery of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, which the
old Popiſh Lawyers never did pretend to, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then as the effect of a

abſurd as to infer from hence, That the Harlot and her Mate are one perſon,
or that they are tranſubſtantiated into one another, but remain two
diſtinct Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they were before; much leſs that the Harlot hath
no propriety in her Goods, and that every Cuſtomer ſhe hath may rob her
Shop, take all her Goods, and beat her, and ſhe have no Action or Remedy
againſt him; or if ſhe catch a Chouſe in her ſnare, that ſhe and her
Complices may rob, ſtrip, ſell him to the <hi>Barbado</hi>'s, and he
ſhall not be allowed to ſue her before the Magiſtrate; becauſe he and
ſhe are in Scripture call'd one fleſh. In like manner may be ſaid of the
foppery of Sacramental Tranſubſtantiations of the Bread into the Body, or
one Body into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or making many perſons in Society or Communion one
perſon, becauſe the Scripture calls them one Body, as it is ſaid, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. <hi>The bread which we break, is it not the Communion of
the Body of Chriſt? For we being many are one Bread, and one Body: for we are
all partakers of that one Bread.</hi> This is intended a figurative but not a

or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, to run on four Feet, or to ſay, Becauſe all theſe
Communicants being Men and Women are by the Scripture call'd one Body,
Figurative or Politick: Therefore to conclude that they are one Body natural,
and one Perſon natural; And as no one body natural, or one perſon natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
can have a diſtinct propriety or a right of Action againſt it ſelf, ſo
none of theſe Communicants, Men and Women, can have the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one

of the Fleſh of a Woman into the Fleſh of a Man in Marriage, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this is eaſily ſhewn, that the Communicants in the later Fantaſtick
Sacrament loſe more Temporally, then in the former, though perhaps the other

he returned home to the Town where he dwelt, and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as ſoon as
they underſtood it, went in ſhew to welcome him home, but withal to ſee
how he would like the increaſe of his Children in his abſence, where after
they had ſat a while, he appeared very kind to his Wife, and very fond of his
Child, which he had left at home at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, ſuppoſing the other to
have been ſome Children of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours who were come in to play with his,
'till a while after ſeeing thoſe Children by his Fire-ſide to draw
cloſer to his Wife then ſtrangers uſe to do, he asked Whoſe the
Children were, the Wife and anſwer'd him, Thine, whereat he was much amazed,
and demanded how that could be, ſeeing he had not been at home ſo many
Years. The Wife replyed, thou might'ſt have ſtayed at home then, and got
them thy ſelf, if thou would'ſt; ſo there being no other Anſwer to be
got, the poor man was glad to take up this new Bag and Baggage, when he thought
to have reſted. For the fiction of Legitimation dared give the Truth of the
Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier the Lie to his face; yet he knew not whom to ſend a Challenge or a

                     <p n="2">Secondly, This incourages Fathers to deflour Virgins,
and when got with Child, to deſert both the Mother and the Child, as a far
cheaper way, then by carrying her firſt to a Prieſt and Temple to draw a
charge on himſelf of her and her Child as long as he lives; this incourages
likewiſe ſuch Fathers to get Children by Inceſt, and Adultery, and
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and any other way which is not lawful, rather then according to
the lawful Ordinance of God; becauſe he can caſt off all theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and

and ſerve them the like, and they ſhall thereby be defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of

                        <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> derived from the ſame, all natural Children
were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Legitimate, the Children would be provided for, by being
by Law made Succeſſors to their Fathers Eſtate, as far as the ſame will
reach, and Fathers would be diſcouraged to get Children unlawfully, when they
ſaw they could not thereby wickedly deſert and make them illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or
evade the Obligation laid on them by the Law of God and Nature, to provide for

greater privilege then a good; and he who doth his Child injury, then he who is
his Benefactor; for a Father who gets a Child unlawfully, doth a double injury
to the Child, and rather ought to make double ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, then if
he got him lawfully; for he diſhonors the Child; and it is a rule in Law,
<hi>None ſhall take advantage of his own wrong;</hi> if the Child is
unlawfully begot, who did the wrong but the Father, who is therefore, if
proved, to be puniſhed for the wrong, and not to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it
againſt his injured Child to illegitimate and diſinherit him: nor much
leſs ought the Law to do it, for no other reaſon, but becauſe the Father
hath done him one wrong to do him another, but in juſtice to be the readier
to make the Father who injured him to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by adjudging him
right of Aliment and Succeſſion to his Eſtate, for as it is
inconſiſtent with Mercy, and the higheſt Cruelty, <hi>Afflictionem addere
afflicto;</hi> ſo is it with Juſtice, becauſe the Coat is taken from an
innocent to take his Cloak alſo, or to make one injury done, the warrant to

                        <note place="margin">No ſuch word as illegitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor no ſuch deed in the whole Scripture.</note>Fourthly, Becauſe there is
no foundation for this unnatural Cruelty of illegitimation, or indeed worſe
then beaſtly expoſing Children to be deſtroyed, in the whole Scripture,
neither is there ſuch a word as Baſtard in the whole Original, Old
Teſtament or New, <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, or <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,</hi> but the
ſame is falſely Tranſlated by Papiſts and Biſhops, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the
World, as ſhall be more fully ſhewn when I after come to the point of
falſe-tranſlation of all words concerning Marriage.</p>
                     <p n="5">Fifthly, All the examples of Scripture of unlawful
Marriages yet Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, and make the Children Succeſſors to their
Fathers in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Marriages; as <hi>Lot</hi> begot <hi>Moab</hi> and
<hi>Ammon</hi> by Inceſt on his own Daughters, yet were <hi>Moab</hi> and
<hi>Ammon</hi> Legitimate Succeſſors to their inceſtuous Father.
<hi>Judah</hi> begot <hi>Pharez</hi> by Inceſt on his Daughter in Law, yet
was he Legitimate Succeſſor to his inceſtuous Father; <hi>David</hi> got
<hi>Solomon</hi> on an Adultereſs, with whom he had committed Adultery in her
Husband's life time, and kill'd her Husband to obtain, yet did not this
illegitimate <hi>Solomon,</hi> but he Succeeded to his Father. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> and the Law of God and Nature, whether
the marriage were lawful or unlawful, yet the Law was amongſt the whole
Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> That all natural

                        </note> and Succeeded to their Fathers; and the
ſame Law was amongſt the <hi>Aegyptians, Athenians, Phoenicians,
Perſians, Turks, Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who though Infidels
have been better then ſuch counterfeit Chriſtians, who make Laws to
illegitimate, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their own Children. O ye <hi>Jews,

againſt Popes and Biſhops, that your Dens, Deſarts, and raging Seas, are
not ſuch <hi>Hells</hi> as the <hi>Limbus puerorum</hi> of illegitimation;
Did you ever illegitimate your little Ones? did ye not labour to provide for

of your young? Riſe up in Judgment againſt theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> wild

their miſerable Fate with weeping and wailing, to be the Iſſue of ſo
unnatural and cruel Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                     <p n="6">Sixthly, I ſhall only add a word concerning the
Original cauſe which produced this wicked effect of illegitimation of
Children, which the curſed invention of Intails by the Prieſt, of the Lands
of the Husband, to the Heirs of the Body of whatſoever Woman he married, or
certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied married to the man; whereby as is before mention'd, the Prieſt by
Certificate, and the Woman by Secrecy, had power to make Succeſſors what
Adulterous Heirs they pleaſed, and moſt commonly begotten by the Prieſt
himſelf to the Husbands Inheritance, to cut off theſe Adulterous Intails,
the moſt ancient whereof we read, were ſet up by <hi>Cecrops</hi> for the
Owls of <hi>Athens;</hi> and King <hi>Aegeus</hi> the natural Father of the
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Theſeus,</hi> was the firſt who invented Adoption to cut them
off, and accordingly Adopted his natural Son <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who thereby
became his Succeſſor to his Kingdom of <hi>Athens,</hi> whereby the
Certificate of the Biſhop was aboliſh'd, and the Supremacy of the Kingdom
taken from the Prieſt to the King, and the free diſpoſing left to Fathers
of their Eſtates, to ſuch Children as they acknowledged, according to the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving or undeſerving of the Children. After this <hi>Solon</hi> who is
thought, though not as wiſe, yet to have been as great a lover of women as
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and to have been drawn by them into as great Idolatry; for
<hi>Solon</hi> as a principal peice of his Government, intended to be ſet up
by his Laws (as ſhall be after further touched) Conſecrated and Founded
Prieſts, and a Temple to the Goddeſs <hi>Venus,</hi> and endowed the ſame
with great Revenues and Privileges, and Conſecrated a multitude of
<hi>Curteſans</hi> to exerciſe their Trade, and pray for the proſperity
of <hi>Greece</hi> in the ſame. And did what he could to reſtrain the free
liberty of Adoption by Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, whereby the Ladies were prejudiced in their
power of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting <pb n="83" facs="tcp:49347:49"/>Heirs to their Husbands Eſtates,
in as free a manner as their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Venus</hi> gave them leave. But the
more <hi>Maſculine</hi> Princes both of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi>
vindicated their own Power of Adoption both againſt the Prieſts and the
Ladies. And <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> without any Formality of Adoption, cut off
at a ſtroke all <hi>Feminine</hi> Intails, by making all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Children as
they ought to be, Legitimate, which continued till (as before mention'd) the
Strumpet <hi>Theodora</hi> and her Biſhops got the Law of
<hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> repealed, and Adulterous Intails again ſet up. And
the like Law was in <hi>England,</hi> Fathers gave what they were bound by the
Law of Nature to give to their natural Children, for proviſion for them, and
they Succeeded to the ſame, 'till the Biſhops for the ſame ends as the
Pagan and <hi>Theodoran</hi> Biſhops did ſet up. Here likewiſe by the
Statute of <hi>Weſtmin.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. thoſe <hi>Feminine</hi>
and Adulterous Intails have been ſince endeavour'd to be cut off by Fines and
Recoveries. But the many Inconveniences of thoſe ways make the Remedy

there is no way to prevent the expoſing and deſertion of Children by

                     <p>Amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> the manner of the Contract of

converſe with the Devil, and their form of Contract of Marriage is no doubt
according as he will have it. For the Woman is there ſworn to the Man, that

admit any other Noble Perſons to preſent themſelves unto her, as

who had lain with her Husband, and for ought the Court knew might be with Child
by him, to put her on the Temptation of changing her Husband, to take a richer,
and thereby leave it to the wicked Canon-Law, which would have null'd her
Marriage, to have illegitimated her Child, only for that deſertion of her

hath always entangled and troubled the meér Iuriſdiction, and regal
power of this Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and alſo unquieted much the
Subjects of the ſame, by his uſurped power in them, as by making that
unlawful which by God's Word is Lawful, both in Marriage and other things, as
hereafter ſhall appear more at length; and till now of late in our Soveraign

after long continuance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Matrimony, without any allegation of either
of the parties, or any other at their Marriage, why the ſame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
ſhould not be good, juſt, and lawful, and after the ſame Matrimony
Solemuized, and Conſummate by carnal knowledge, and alſo ſometimes fruit
of Children enſued of the ſame Marriage, upon pretence of former Contract
made, and not Conſummate by carnal Copulation (for proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, two
Witneſſes by that Law were only required) beén divorced and
ſeparate, contrary to God's Law, and ſo the true Matrimony both ſo
Solemnized in the face of the Church, and Conſummate with bodily knowledge,

cleérly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and diſſolved: Further alſo, by reaſon of
other Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions then God's Law admitteth, for their lucre by that Court
invented; the diſpenſation whereof, they always reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to

elſe were lawful, and be not prohibited by God's-Law, and becauſe they

(contrary to God's ordinance) ariſen much debate and ſuits at Law, with

elſe, but for his vain-glorious uſurpation, beén moved any ſuch

ought to be moſt ſure and certain. But that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding marriages
have been brought into ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty thereby, that no marriage could
be ſurely knit and bounden, but it ſhould lye in either of the parties
power, and arbiter, caſting away the fear of God, by means and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to prove a pre-contract, a kindred, and alliance, or a carnal knowledge to
defeat the ſame, and ſo under the pretence of theſe allegations afore
rehearſed, to live all the days of their lives in deteſtable adultery, to

                     <p n="1">1. Here it appears what a neceſſary ſtroke this
Act gave, againſt the uſurped power of Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and
Juriſdiction, in this and other points of Marriage, forbidding any Spiritual
Courts within this Realm, or any his other Lands and Dominions, to admit any
Proceſs, Plea, or Allegation, contrary to this Act. And although hereby, one
of the heads of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction was, as is ſaid of the
Beaſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.3. as it were <hi>wounded to death;</hi> yet ſo
great was the ſubtilty of the Serpent, that the Eccleſiaſtics ſoon
after, by abuſing the minority of that moſt pious, though young King,
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, got all what the wiſdom and courage of his Father
had Enacted againſt them, repealed by the Son, 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3

Precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</note>And thinking themſelves therein not ſufficiently
ſecure, they again procured the ſame to be repealed by 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1.
In which repeals, I can ſee nothing but a Papiſt Plot againſt them both,
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Laws by their own Authority againſt
themſelves, which might have yielded moſt dangerous pretences againſt
their own Legitimations and Marriages, and Iſſue, if they had happen'd to
have had any: For certainly no Marriage or Iſſue can be ſecure or
certain, if any fraudulent perſon may ſecretly pre-contract, or
pre-copulate with any vile perſon, and take Bonds of him, or her, to
releaſe the ſame upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and then marry another perſon, Ignorant
and Innocent, and have Children procreate between them, and then cauſe the
party who had the pre-contract or pre-copulation, to ſue and obtain a Divorce
againſt the Innocent perſon to be Divorced, and Children Baſtardized, and
Diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited; and then to give a releaſe to the party conſpiring in the
fraud. How is it poſſible to avoid this wickedneſs, if pre-contract or
pre-copulation, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:49347:57"/>ſhould be allowed a ſufficient cauſe
to diſſolve Marriage, Conſummate by the Birth of a Child? And how is it
poſſible propriety to be, if a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be not kept between it and
contract, and between obligation and poſſeſſion, according to the old
Rule of Law, <hi>Rem Domino vel non Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no vendente duobus, in jure eſt

leaſt reaſon, except only this, That if pre-contract ſhould not
diſſolve Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the parties might part from one another at the Church
door, and then the Wedding Dinner would be ſpoiled; which ſurely may be
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and over ſatisfied by recompence in value, were it a
Half-Crown Ordinary: But a loſt Virginity to an Innocent Woman, who was

many inconveniences had chanced in this Realm, by breaking and diſſolving
of good and lawful Marriages, yea whereupon alſo ſometimes Iſſue and
Children had followed, under the colour and pretence of a former Contract made
with another, the which Contract divers times was but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlenderly proved,
and often but ſurmiſed, by the malice of the party, who deſired to be
diſſolved from the Marriage which they liked not, and to be coupled with
another. There was an Act made, That all, and every ſuch Marriages as within
the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be Contracted and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized in the
face of the Church, and Conſummate with Bodily knowledge, or fruit of
Children or Child, being had between the parties ſo married, ſhould be by
Authority of the <pb n="100" facs="tcp:49347:58"/>ſaid Parliament, Deémed, Iudged,

any pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or pre-contracts of Matrimony, not Conſummate with Bodily
knowledge, which either of the Perſons ſo married, or both, had made with
any other Perſon or Perſons, before the time of Contracting of that
Marriage, which is Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized or Conſummated, or whereof ſuch fruit is
enſued, or may enſue, as by the ſame Act more plainly may appear. Since
the time of which Act. although the ſame was Godly meant, the unrulineſs of
Men hath ungodlily abuſed the ſame, and divers inconveniences (intolerable
in manner to Chriſtian Ears and Eyes) followed thereupon, Women and Men
breaking their own promiſes, and faiths, made by the one unto the other; ſo
ſet upon ſenſuality and pleaſure, that if after the Contract of
Matrimony, they might have whom they more favoured and deſired, they could be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented by lightneſs of their nature, to over-turn all that they had done
afore, and not afraid in manner, even from the very Church-door, and Marriage
Feaſt, the Man to take another Spouſe, and the Spouſe to take another
Husband, more for Bodily luſt and carnal knowledge, then for ſurety of
faith &amp; truth, or having God in their good remembrance, contemning many
times alſo the Commandment of the Eccleſiaſtical Iudge, forbidding the
parties, having made the Contract, to attempt or do any thing in prejudice of
the ſame. Be it therefore Enacted by the King's Highneſs, The Lords

be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween perſons not prohibited by the Law of God to marry,
Fornication.</head>
                     <p>Private Marriage, or carnal knowledge is of two ſorts, the
one without publick Witneſs, the other without any Witneſs at all, and both
by the Popiſh Laws (becauſe if permitted, they would ſpoil their gains)
are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and called clandeſtine Marriages. The publick Witneſſes
are the Prieſt or Magiſtrate; private Witneſſes are any other,<note place="margin">Marriage without Witneſs nor clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</note> not
appointed by Law. The Law of <hi>England</hi> makes all private Marriage, and
carnal knowledge, without publick Witneſs, Fornication. The Law of
<hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in ſome caſes relieves, though there be a defect and no
publick Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Marriage by the Prieſt, as appears in the before
cited Author <hi>Craig. Feud.</hi> 269. If there appear private Witneſſes
of Men or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but in all caſes likewiſe, where there are
neither publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Witneſſes, they leave it to be Fornication.
That which I here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm againſt both, is:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <note place="margin">Marriage without Witneſs not
Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>1. That carnal knowledge between parties not prohibited by
the Law of God to marry, is not Fornication, nor any other Crime, though in the
higheſt ſecrecy, and without any Teſtimony of Men, or Inſtruments
whatſoever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That privacy of Marriage being not prohibited, nor
publication commanded by God; all parties ought to have liberty of
Conſcience, to uſe the one or the other, according as ſuits beſt with
their occaſions.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, there are theſe reaſons. That private
Marriage without Witneſs is not Fornication, nor any other Crime.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no Law of God prohibiting private Marriage
without Witneſs: <hi>Where there is therefore no Law, there is no
tranſgreſſion.</hi> Rom. 4.15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is before ſhewen, That for any human Law to
prohibit Marriage or Meat, where not prohibited by the Law of God, the ſame
came from <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49347:59"/>the Devil. 1 <hi>Tim. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi>
1, 2, 3. And that therefore the Law of the Pope, and Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
which <hi>nulls</hi> all Marriages, except made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prieſt in a Temple,
and two Witneſſes; came from the Devil and the Prieſts of
<hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> for filthy lucre to the Prieſts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.7. It is ſaid, <hi>I create
evil.</hi> And <hi>Iſa</hi> 5.20. It is ſaid, <hi>Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that call
good evil, and evil good; That put darkneſs for light, and light for
darkneſs:</hi> Here is therefore a curſe pronounced againſt thoſe, who,
if God created not marriage without Witneſſes, evil, of their own heads
call it evil; and where God created it to be in darkneſs, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
modeſty, of their own heads will have it by Torch-light, and the whole
Pariſh of Witneſſes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All Fornication is <hi>Polyandry</hi> and
<hi>Confuſio ſeminum,</hi> whereby the Child cannot know the Father, nor
the Father the Child, but here is no ſuch thing; it is impoſſible
therefore to be Fornication.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Liberty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to marry with or

That privacy of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without Witneſſes, being not prohibited by the
Law of God, nor publication commanded by the ſame; no human power ought to
preſume to prohibit what Marriage God hath not prohibited, but all perſons
ought to be left liberty of Conſcience, to marry publickly or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
with or without Witneſſes, as it ſuits beſt with their convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and occaſions, as is the uſe and practice in all other civil Contracts,
which men do with or without Witneſſes, as they think beſt, and were
never accuſed of ſin, if they had no Witneſſes whereon to bring their
Action; only that Party is juſtly charged with ſin, who wilfully breaks his
Contracts, becauſe there are no Witneſſes but God to prove it againſt
him.</p>

might perhaps have ſomething reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Man, yet this Law that the

                        </label> To which is Anſwer'd, Firſt,
This preſerves not the Claymant's right, nor prevents the other man's lying
with the Woman, if ſhe hath a mind to another. Which it appears ſhe hath,
otherwiſe ſhe would not have band her ſelf openly with him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If he hath a pre-promiſe or pre-contract, he
ought not to recover the Woman <hi>in Specie</hi> againſt her will, but only
damage for breach of promiſe, as to which the Banes make it neither better
nor worſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Admit the man who is the Claymant of the Woman,
hath not only had pre-promiſe, pre-contract, but pre-copulation of the Woman
before the other man, who is publickly band with her, yet to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is
a claim made of a Woman, who is now became an Adultereſs by banning her
ſelf with another man, and ought not by the Law of God to be claimed by the
firſt man; for by retaking an Adultereſs the Husband becomes a Pandor to
the Wife, a deſtroyer of the Adultererous Child, by depriving him of the
natural Father, and a deſtroyer of his own Children, by bringing in
Adulterous Heirs amongſt them, which is ſo far abhor'd by the Scripture,
that in caſe of Divorce, though the Woman is innocent, yet it is ſaid
<hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1, 2, 3, 4. according to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, <hi>When a man hath
taken a Woman, and been a Man unto her, and it come to paſs that ſhe find
no favour in his eyes, becauſe he hath found ſome uncleanneſs in her:
then let him write her a Bill of Divorcement, and give it in her hand, and
ſend her out of his Houſe. And when ſhe is departed out of his Houſe,
ſhe may go and be another man's Woman. And if the latter man hate her, and
write her a Bill of Divorcement, and give it in her hand, and ſendeth her out
of his Houſe: or if the latter man die, which took her to be his Woman, her
former man which ſent her away, may not take her again to be his Woman, after
ſhe is defiled: for that is abomination before the Lord, and thou ſhalt not
cauſe the Land to ſin, which the Lord thy God, giveth thee for an
inheritance.</hi> If therefore a Woman innocent put away, is not to be received
again, much leſs is a Woman guilty of running. away with another man to be
claimed again <hi>in Specie,</hi> but there is a more juſt remedy, if the
Party is thereby damaged, to Sue the Woman for breach of her Contract, and the
Adulterer for taking her away, for Damages.</p>

<hi>That without Witneſſes of the Marriage, if the right of Succeſſions

That lawful Marriage is impoſſible to be without carnal knowledg, and ſo

<note place="margin">Marriage what.</note>As to carnal

it is impoſſible, though their eyes ſaw the external Copulation, that

the <hi>Scots</hi> Cuſtom was to make themſelves merry at their Weddings,
that the next day after the Brideall night, when Dinner was ended, and a Voider
brought in, the Bridegroom was to ſtand with a Creile or Basket on his Back,
and the Company uſed as they pleaſed to throw into the ſame as into a
Voider, ſo long till the Bride in good-nature took it off from him with her
own hand, which the fooner ſhe did, the better Wife they judged ſhe would
be; the Bridegroom being put to this task of the Creile, many loaded upon him
ſo long, and the Bride ſhewing no pity releive him, he looked back very
wiſtly on her, as he thought, ſaying, <hi>Sweet-heart will you not help
me?</hi> She Anſwer'd, <hi>No, I am a Maid,</hi> whereat the company fell a
laughing which much amuſed the Bridegroom, at laſt after they had made
ſufficient ſport with him about it, the true Bride was brought down the
ſtairs, who took off his Burden; the other who refuſed, being her Siſter
dreſs'd in her Cloaths. Here might far eaſier have been a deceit impoſed,

Publick Wooing cauſeth diſhonour to each Party, and if any Man addreſs
himſelf publickly to a Lady as a Suiter, and after ſight likes her not, but
deſerts her, this will diſparage her, the thoughts of the next that is

                        <note place="margin">Cauſeth Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Stews,
and Brothels.</note>Sixthly, Denial of liberty of private Marriage, and
puniſhing the ſame, as Fornication, compells men to what is true
Fornication and Adultery; for if men cannot be allowed ſecret Marriage, and
ſecret Wives, without Witneſſes they will take ſecret Fornication and
Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and ſecret Whores and Adultereſſes without Witneſſes,
which is a Thouſand times worſe. So what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays,
<hi>Deme lupanaria &amp; turbabis omnia libidinibus,</hi> is not true, nor is
Toleration of Stews the Remedy appointed by God to cure Luſt; but private
Marriage is the Remedy appointed by God to cure the Stews; for it is ſaid by
<hi>Paul, To avoid Fornication, let every Man have his own Woman, and every
Woman her own Man,</hi> which if denied to ſuch Perſons, with whoſe
Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or Conſcience it ſtands not, to take a Woman or a Man
publickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Witneſſes, and a Prieſt in a Temple, is to deny them to
take any Man or Woman at all. Whereas if liberty were given of private
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without Witneſſes, to ſuch Perſons as are not by the Law of
God prohibited to marry, this would deſtroy all Stews and Brothel-Houſes: 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49347:62"/>for what Man or Woman who have liberty to chooſe whom
they like beſt, and to enjoy them privately to themſelves, would be ſo
mad to hazard themſelves in common Stews, to be infected with thoſe
miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deadly Diſeaſes, to be robbed, ſtript, have their
Throats cut, or at leaſt, ſpirited to a Ship, ſold to <hi>Barbado</hi>'s
or <hi>Barbary?</hi> or if they ſcape thoſe greater dangers, to be all
their Lives perſued by Conſtables, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Bedels, hooted at by Boys,
Carted, Whipt, Pumpt, and to come to <hi>Bridewell,</hi> and Beggary at
laſt.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Publick Marriages are too coſtly for the Poor,
therefore to prohibit them private Marriage,<note place="margin">Too coſtly for
the poor.</note> is to prohibit them all Marriage, except ſuch as will undo
them; the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> himſelf, dares not venture on that is
publick, or the coſt of it, which is one reaſon he is never married
publickly by a Prieſt in a Temple.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">One Man may have reaſon to marry
pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and another not, and one to marry public and another
not.</note>Eighthly, There may be many reaſons likewiſe both for Rich and
Poor to marry ſecretly, and one man may have a Reaſon, which another hath
not; and it may be not only inconvenient, but dangerous to one, and not to
another; therefore it is fit every man (ſeeing it is not prohibited by God)
ſhould have liberty to marry publick or private, with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Witneſſes, as it ſuits beſt with his conveniencies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> married <hi>Ann
Bulloigne,</hi> the Mother of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> on the 14 of
<hi>Novemb.</hi> and kept the ſame ſo ſecret, that it was not known till
<hi>Eaſter</hi> after, when ſhe appeared great with Child. And
Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> was married, and kept it ſo ſecret, that it
was not known, till diſcovered by the King. No doubt the King and
Arch-Biſhop both had very good reaſons for what they did, though they
thought not fit to divulge them, either before or after. So <hi>Abraham</hi>
and <hi>Iſaac</hi> both endeavoured to keep their Marriages ſecret, by
telling lies: they had very good reaſon for their Secrecy, though not for
their Lies.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid, appears therefore to be
proved,</p>
                     <p n="1">Firſt, That private marriage, or carnal knowledg
without Witneſſes, between Perſons not prohibited by the Law of God to
marry, is not Fornication, or any other Crime.</p>
                     <p n="2">Secondly, That it is a remedy provided by God to
prevent Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the ſame if not forbidden by Papal,
Epiſcopal, Pontifical, or other Diabolical Laws, would overthrow all Stews,
Brothels, and common Whores, and the whole Myſtery of Iniquity of the

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">Thirdly, That it is a great ſin to forbid to marry:
And that thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to marry, who forbid either publick or private

                     <p>This irrational Law is put in practice, where a Man and
Woman not prohibited to marry by the Law of God, cohabit or keep private

every Woman her own Husband, by the teſtimony of Witneſſes, which is as
frivolous, when the parties themſelves acknowledge (though as is before

elſe pretends claim to the Man or Woman, as 'tis to require Witneſſes of
every one poſſeſſed of Lands or Goods, or to force him to anſwer to a

ſaith; <hi>Si lex humana conjugia inter certas perſonas contrahi prohibeat;

Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween certain perſons, it doth not therefore follow, that it
makes ſuch Marriage void, if it be actually contracted; for to prohibit a

there is no other Law of <hi>England,</hi> if that of the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> is excluded, which makes any Marriage of Proteſtant or

void, it is valid, and hath all the rights of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Marriage, and the

that the ſame, and the birth of a Child, and not Ceremonies make Matrimony;
and that both Marriage, and Filiation are impoſſible to be proved by any
Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, except the Parents admit: Therefore if the Canon of
<hi>Trent</hi> were confirmed by Act of Parliament, or a thouſand Acts of

Fahers, it comes all to one, whether they give Portions with Daughters, or
none, if there were ſuch a Law; for if <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> have each
of them three Sons and three Daughters, and <hi>A</hi> give Portions with his
Daughters, to the Sons of <hi>B,</hi> and <hi>B</hi> give back 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49347:65"/>again thoſe Portions with his Daughters to the Sons of
<hi>A,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing got on either ſide, but the trouble and hazard
of tumbiing in and out the money, and the vexation of Lawyers with their foul
Fines, and crabbed Concords, to do and undo all again like Juglers knots. The
<hi>Venetians</hi> had a Law none ſhould give above fifteen hundred Crowns,
others ſay ſixteen hundred Duckats with a Daughter, yet are they very rich.
<hi>Bodin</hi> cries out againſt high Portions, and ſaith, <hi>That by the

hundred Crowns with a Daughter, and five Crowns in Apparel.</hi> And a Law was
made by <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, forbidding to give a Daughter above a

but Twelve hundred pounds ſterling to her Dowry. Some will ſay it was very
much, conſidering the ſcarcity of Gold and Silver in thoſe days, but the
difference is likewiſe very great betwixt a thouſand pounds, and four
hundred thouſand Crowns: It is true, ſhe was the goodlieſt Princeſs of
her Age, and of the greateſt Houſe that was at that day. <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth gave for Portions to his Daughters, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but Ten thouſand pounds a piece. And if we will ſeek
higher, we ſhall find that in the Law of God, the Marriage of a Daughter was
taxed but a fifty Skekells, which makes at moſt but four pounds ſterling of

                        </gap>oeciſin in the
Policy both of Monarchies and States; for it is apparent by the Coats and
Titles, that many Families quarter; the Subjects grow more Rich and Potent than
the Prince. This was prevented by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, by raiſing up Seed
to the Brother, and by marrying of Inheritrixes to the next Kinſman; as
likewiſe did the <hi>Athenians.</hi> It was prevented in <hi>Perſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, Armenia, Africk,</hi> and almoſt through all
the Eaſt, by limiting the Succeſſion of Inheritances, by a kind of
<hi>Salique</hi> Law, only to the Males, and giving only the Moveables to the
Daughters; till <hi>Theodora,</hi> to ſet up her Foeminine Militia, got her
Blunderbus <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to repeal that Antient Law. Now though a Family
<hi>Salique</hi> is of excellent uſe to preſerve the equality of private
Families: yet in Royal Families it is contrary to all ſound Policy, hindring
the Union of Kingdoms by Marriage; for private Families may be too Potent, but
Kingdoms cannot. In other Nations equality of private Families are preſerved
by <hi>Gavelkind</hi> amongſt the Sons, and <hi>Parcenary</hi> amongſt the
Daughters; and amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> by limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Primogeniture to no
more than a double Portion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another Miſchief to the Publick of marrying
Daughters with great Protions, is, it foments Seditions, and hinders the Union
between <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and between Poor and Rich;
as we ſee in <hi>Rome,</hi> where they married for great Portions, they would
take the handſomeſt Daughters of the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and abuſe, but
not marry them; becauſe though they had Beauty to anſwer their Luſt, they
had no money to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their Covetouſneſs. But amongſt the great
Eaſtern Princes, where they buy and receive no Portion from their Wives, they
marry the Poor equally with the Rich, which is no queſtion a great obligation
on their Subjects, by becoming, as it were, the ſame fleſh and blood with
them; who ſeeing the Daughter of a Maſon, Queen in the great Kingdom of
<hi>China;</hi> and the Daughter of an Herb-Woman, <hi>Sultana</hi> to the
<hi>Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> 
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49347:66"/>and their Princes born of
theſe; they think themſelves highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to be of equal blood with
their Princes. In like manner the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Cuſtom of the <hi>Babylonians</hi>
and <hi>Indians</hi> of ſelling the faireſt Virgins to the Rich for Money,
and giving that Money to the unhandſom to be Wives for the Poor, united the
Poor and Rich by Marriages.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another great Inconvenience is, The Father gives
ſo great a Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Mother, that when he dies, ſhe marries another
Husband, and ſtarves her firſt Husband's Children; and the Father he gets
ſo great a Portion, and Courteſie of the whole Eſtate of the Mother, that
he marries when ſhe dies, another Wife, and brings in a Step-Mother over his
firſt Wive's Children: whoſe good quality the Poet expreſſeth:

                     <p n="5">5. To marry for Money, ſhackles Young Men to Old
Women, and Young Women to Old Men, and perſons loath'd one to another;
whereby they become miſerable both Body and Soul, and fall into Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and

Whereas were there not the Temptation of great Portions, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies by
Courteſie, Jointures, Dowers, Thirds, every one would marry where they beſt
liked, and might thereby live vertuouſly and happily all their days.</p>
                     <p>This hath been endeavour'd to be remedied by the Civil Law,
in the Title <hi>De Donationibus inter virum &amp; uxorem,</hi> by making all
Gifts void between a Man and his Wife; and the ſame Law gives another
Reaſon of it, <hi>Ne nimio amore ſpolientur,</hi> leſt the party who
loved leaſt ſhould rob moſt, and the worſt Nature make a prey of the
beſt. The Common Law pretended likewiſe, in imitation of the Civil Law, to
make all Gifts void between <hi>Baron</hi> and <hi>Feme;</hi> but it
diſſembled: for it forbid ſuch Gifts to be made directly, but encouraged
them to be done indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly by <hi>Chancery</hi> truſts, which is ten times
worſe.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> to prevent the taking away the
Eſtate of one Family by another by theſe Marriage-Gifts, or Covenants, they
have an Excellent Law and of great Equity, which makes them void, as appears by
<hi>Craig. Feud.</hi> 307. but 'tis only in one Caſe, which is, when two
perſons have Marriage-Covenants for Portion and Jointure, agreed and
ſigned, and they are accordingly married thereon: If either the Man or Woman
die within the Year after Marriage, without any Iſſue between them; the 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49347:66"/>Writings of the Portion and Marriage ſhall be all void,
and the right of the Portion return to the Father of the Woman, and the
Jointure to the Father of the Man, and both Families be <hi>in Statu quo</hi>
they were before the Marriage.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Arabians, Brittons,</hi> and other Nations, to the
intent that one Family might not by Marriage Gifts rob another, always married
in the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and Brothers and Siſters married, making that Religion
to marry in the Family, which others made Inceſt; and that Inceſt to marry
out of the Family, which others made Religion:<note place="margin">Portions and

Family, but there are many more Lawful ways before mention'd, and amongſt the
reſt, the making all ſuch Gifts, foraſmuch as is Super-alimenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, void,

of Divorce between Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſecret <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs of Children in their
Parents Houſes to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tribunals, contrary to the Law of God.</head>
                     <p>It will be Objected, How ſhould thoſe Sins of Carnal
Uncleanneſs be puniſhed, if not brought before a publick Judge?</p>
                     <p>'Tis Anſwer'd, Far better than by him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It not denied, but publick Fornication and
Adultery, where there are Witneſſes, belong to publick Juſtice to
puniſh, as where <hi>Diogenes</hi> lay with a Woman in midſt of the Market;
or as <hi>Leo Afer</hi> mentions, where a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Prophet lay with
another man's Wife at a publick Bath in ſight of a multitude of
By-ſtanders. It is not denied likewiſe, but Bawds, Panders, Stews,
Brothel-Houſes, where are Witneſſes, are and ought to be ſeverely
puniſhed by the publick Magiſtrate. But the Queſtion is, of ſuch
Fornication and Adultery which are generally ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, as none but the
Parties themſelves can witneſs againſt themſelves: theſe appear
expreſly by the Scripture it ſelf, that they belong neither 
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49347:67"/>to Prieſt nor Magiſtrate, to judg or puniſh, but
only to God: for it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Secret things belong
unto the Lord our God: but thoſe things which are revealed, belong unto us
and our Children.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Marriage is honourable in
all, and the Bed undefiled: but Whoremongers and Adulterers God ſhall
judg.</hi> It is not ſaid man ſhall judg of ſecret ſins, but God. And
<hi>Deut.</hi> 17.6. It is ſaid, <hi>At the mouth of two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, or
three Witneſſes, ſhall he that is worthy of death, be put to death, but
at the mouth of one Witneſs, he ſhall not be put to death.</hi> And 19.15.
<hi>One Witneſs ſhall not riſe up againſt a man for any Iniquity, or
for any ſin, in any ſin that he ſinneth: at the mouth of two
Witneſſes, or at the mouth of three Witneſſes, ſhall the matter be
eſtabliſhed.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Againſt an Elder receive
not an Accuſation, but before two or three Witneſſes.</hi> And there is
very great reaſon that man ſhould not preſume to uſurp on the
Juriſdiction of God, in things ſecret, eſpecially in theſe and other
offences of uncleanneſs. For</p>
                     <p n="1">Firſt, This many times indangers the lives of
innocent Parties, how many <hi>Joſeph's,</hi> how many
<hi>Athanaſiuſſe's,</hi> how many <hi>Suſanna</hi>'s, have been
falſly accuſed. How far from the Law of God or Juſtice,<note place="margin">Juſtices of Peace ought not to receive accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of
Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the ſingle Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a leud Woman.</note> is therefore
the proceedings of Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and many Juſtices of Peace, who
without any other Witneſs, then ſo incompetent a one as a leud Woman who is
the Party, and gains by it, charge and puniſh men for Baſtardy and
Fornication, and contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Petition of
Right,</hi> and all the Fundamental Laws of the Land, made for preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Liberty and Propriety of the People, the one by cauſing
<hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatos Capiendo</hi>'s, the other by Warrants, ſend whom they
will to Goal, and Impriſon them at their pleaſure? And how far again from
the Law of God or Juſtice is the compelling men for theſe Crimes to
ſelf-accuſation, when they can get no Witneſſes as they ought to
have.</p>
                     <p n="2">Secondly, Publick Inquiſitions and Puniſhments of
theſe Crimes of uncleanneſs, do more corrupt then reform both Judg and
People. For the Judg, example may be taken from Auricular Confeſſors, who
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of injoining Penance to others, learn to be above all others
the moſt debauch'd themſelves: and as to the People, it is either a
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencing or incouragement to all ſuch as are rich, who for a little
Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation-Money buy the Pope's Pardon, or what is equivalent, the Biſhops,
or the Kirks; or if they will not ſuffer them to Commute, the People when
they ſee the Nobles in the Stools of Repentance, will think it an honour to
follow them, and beſides, for People to hear or ſee the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Examinations and Stories of uncleanneſs in publick Courts, they oftentimes do
but learn more wickedneſs then ever they knew or thought of before, and are
leſs corrupted at a Play-Houſe then ſuch a Scene of Juſtice. All this
is far better puniſhed in every private Family between the Parents, if there
be juſt cauſe, by Divorce one of another <pb n="120" facs="tcp:49347:68"/>without
publiſhing the cauſe, and if there be no cauſe amongſt the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
by taking away as much of their Portions as the offence deſerves, and giving
the ſame to the innocent Children, and by good inſtruction, reproofs, and
virtuous example of the Parents, which will prevent more offences in Children,
then Tribunals can ever reform, though they have Witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Lycurgus</hi> by commanding in his Laws, That all
Captains of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Prieſts of Temples, ſhould marry, and that
Husbands them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould come to their Wives, <hi>Furtim &amp;
verecunde;</hi> and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be modeſtly Educated, left <hi>Sparta</hi>
ſo clean from unchaſt demeanour, that when <hi>Geradas,</hi> an old
<hi>Spartan,</hi> was asked by a ſtranger, What was the Puniſhment of
Adultery in <hi>Sparta,</hi> for he could find no Law made by <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
concerning that Crime; Oh Friend ſays he, There is no Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer with us,
When he reply'd, But what if there ſhould be any? <hi>Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> told him,
He ſhould pay a Bull ſo big as ſhould be able to ſtretch his Neck over
<hi>Taygetus,</hi> and Drink of <hi>Eurotas,</hi> when the other laughing,
ſaid, There is not ſuch a Bull to be found; Neither, quoth
<hi>Geradas,</hi> Is an Adulterer to be found in <hi>Sparta,</hi> where Riches,
Luxury, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneſs of Apparel are counted a diſgrace; and Modeſty and
Obedience to Magiſtrates an Honour. Where the Seminaries of Vices are not
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, how can Vices grow?</p>
                     <p n="1">Firſt, Therefore as to Man and Wife, as <hi>Bodin
lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. ſays, Nothing ſeems more pernicious, then to
compel the cauſe of Divorce to be ſhewn before a Judg: for in ſo doing,
the honour of one or both Parties is hazarded, which would not be, if neither
of them were compel'd to prove the ſame before a Judg; as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
in <hi>Alcib.</hi> relates, That when the Wife of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> went to
complain of him before the Judg, he came after her into the Court, and took her
by force, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her away home on his Shoulders, <hi>Ne Secreta Fori
Panderet,</hi> whereat the Judg only ſmiled. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> likewiſe
uſed to make their Bills of Divorce without a cauſe; neither is it
prohibited by Chriſt, if there were a true cauſe, to put her away by
private Bill, without publick Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal or Judg; for ſuch were all the Bills
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and no publick Judg required to judg of the Cauſe, but
only the Conſcience of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And <hi>Joſeph</hi> having a juſt
cauſe of ſuſpicion againſt <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, did not bring her
before a Judg; and is commended for ſo doing, to be a juſt man; as
<hi>Matth.</hi> 1.19. is ſaid, <hi>Then</hi> Joſeph <hi>her Husband being a
juſt man, and not willing to make her a publick Example, was minded to put
her away privily.</hi> So doth <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Aemil.</hi> relate of
<hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> Who according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
ſhewed no cauſe of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away his Wife, but affirmed her very honeſt,
wife, and nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and by whom he had alſo many fair Children; but
when he was preſs'd by her Friends to ſhew the cauſe why he would then
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49347:68"/>he ſhewed them his Shoo, which was very
handſomely and well made, and yet ſays he, <hi>None of you know, but my
ſelf feeleth where it wrings my Foot.</hi> By which doing the Woman is not
diſhonour'd, but may marry with another ſuitable to her quality; and the
ſame liberty had the Wives to divorce themſelves from their Husbands,
without proving or ſhewing any cauſe before a publick Judg. This likewiſe
preſerves the repute of the Children, who though innocent, will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
perpetually bear the reproach, if the diſhonour either of their Father or
Mother be publiſh'd before a Judg. And further, as to drawing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
offences of uncleanneſs of Children, eſpecially of Daughters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a
Judg, who are under the Family <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> either of Father or
Mother, or Husband, the ſame is an undoing to thoſe who offend: for though
they never ſo much repent and amend, yet there can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of their
ſhame, or name when publiſh'd; and the innocent, who are the Father, and
Mother, and Husband, and the other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the diſhonour can never be
taken again from them. <hi>Seneca</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who in all other things was a
great honourer of the virtue of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> yet blames, as a great
overſight in that wiſe Emperour, that he puniſhed the Adulteries of his
Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> publickly by Baniſhment. <hi>Quae potius,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>Principi tacenda quàm vindicanda ſunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">Secondly, It makes every petty difference between Man
and Wife irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable, and heightens Contention from a ſmall ſpark, by
blowing it abroad to ſo great a flame, that it is at laſt unquenchable; for
the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of many things, neither criminous nor ſinful, may affect
ſome modeſt Natures with as deep a ſence of diſgrace, as thoſe that
are falſe, as much as thoſe that are true, and when once publiſhed,
cannot by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be again revoked, but may cauſe ſuch hatred between
the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as will never again admit them to live together.</p>
                     <p n="3">Thirdly, Where offences are not publiſhed, they oft
times may with honour be forgiven, and the Parties reconciled, which if
publiſh'd can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. So <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> forgave the Adultery of
<hi>Fauſtina,</hi> and would not draw it to publick Judgment, to prevent his
own ſhame. And <hi>Ael. Spart.</hi> writes, That the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi>
did the like to his Empreſs, who though he ſuſpected, yet put not away,
but only removed ſuch Courtiers from his Court as he ſuſpected.</p>

ſo frequent in after-times, not as is vainly pretended, out of wantonneſs,

privately between the parties themſelves, without drawing the cauſe to
publick Tribunals, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict Chriſt himſelf, who ſpeaks of a
private Divorce by a Bill both from the Husband and the Wife, according to
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and not a publick Sentence of any Judge; and by the
exception of uncleanneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Innocent party to marry another: but
the Pope's Law, which prohibits it, doth it to no other end then to get the
gains to his Courts, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:49347:70"/>by the Juriſdiction of Divorces,
and to compel the parties, either to make uſe of his Stews, whence he gathers
his common Rents, or to pay him a private <hi>Taxa Camerae</hi> for ſuch
Women as he will allow, when he hath tied him from his Wife by the Divorce;
Neither doth Chriſt take the private Juriſdiction from the Husband or Wife
of Divorce given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but only prohibits to uſe it without a
Lawful cauſe. In the ſame manner did the Laws of the <hi>Romans</hi> allow
the ſame Juriſdiction, both to the Husband and the Wife, as appears by many

<hi>à vinculo matrimonii,</hi> and the parties may marry again: But by

So do the Popiſh Laws and Canons forbid Papiſts to marry Proteſtants,

command the Child not to honour the Father who begat him; and command the true
Father to illegitimate and abdicate his Child, which was truly begotten: And
this they do either by the Ceremonial Law and Canons, or Traditions of Popes.
But if both Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Laws and Traditions of <hi>Moſes</hi> and

makes a Marriage by joining the little fingers of the Man and Woman together,
neer a fire. The <hi>Braſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> without any Ceremony, yet Adultery is
with them death. Amongſt the <hi>Memeſſes,</hi> the Man and his Bride are
ſet a ſtride on a Horſe, both blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſo led into a Grove, there
taken down and married by their Rites; then ſet up again blinded as before,
and conveyed with their company, and Muſick, and Singing to their Houſe,
there taken down and had to Bed, ſtill blinded till the next morrow; in the
mean while the company continue drinking. <hi>Barclay.</hi> In
<hi>Muſcovy</hi> they ride to Church, they uſe a Ring and joining of Hands,
ſhe knocks her Head againſt his Shoe, and he throws the lap of his Garment
over her. In <hi>Peru,</hi> the Man marries the Woman by putting an
<hi>Ottoga</hi> or Shoe on her Foot, if ſhe were a Maid the Shoo was of
<hi>Wool,</hi> if a Widow of <hi>Reeds.</hi> The <hi>Mexican</hi> Prleſts
married the parties by tying a corner of the Man's Gown and the Woman's Vail
together, and ſo lead them to the Man's Houſe; where there was a fire ready
kindled and made, the married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple walk ſeven times about the fire, and
ſo they become married. In the old <hi>Greek</hi> Marriages, when the Bride
came to her Husband's Houſe, they uſed to throw Figs on her Head, and the
company to ſcramble for them: The Woman as <hi>Lactan.</hi> touches, was
likewiſe to be ſet in the lap of <hi>Priap.</hi> The old <hi>Roman</hi>
cuſtom, was by eating a piece of Barley-Cake before the Prieſt, and other
Ceremonies. The <hi>Cimbri</hi> had a cuſtom, That ſuch as would marry,
after the Marriage agreed on, they each of them pared their Nails of Fingers
and Toes, and ſent the parings one to another, which, when they had mutually
received; this was eſteemed a holy and firm <pb n="129" facs="tcp:49347:72"/>Marriage,
and they became Man and Wife. The <hi>Teutonians</hi> rounded one anothers
Hair. The <hi>Elamites</hi> pricked one anothers finger. The <hi>Numidians</hi>
anointed one another with ſpittle and clay. In <hi>Rome,</hi> the Bridegroom
and Bride married not by their own proper names, but by the name of
<hi>Cajus</hi> and <hi>Caja;</hi> they uſed to call themſelves by the name
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Juno;</hi> ſo the Poet though never ſo poor a
fellow, he ſays, <hi>Eja, mi</hi> Juno, <hi>non decet te tam triſtem eſse
tuo</hi> Jovi. And in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> the Bridegroom and Bride are called
the Duke and the Dutcheſs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Armenians</hi> amongſt other Ceremonies meet at
the high Altar, and lean Fore-head to Fore-head; then comes the Prieſt, and
turning his back to the Altar, layes his Bible on their Heads inſtead of a
Desk, a weight ſufficiently heavy, being a thick ponderous Folio; there he
lets it lye till he reads the Form of Matrimony. The <hi>Scythians</hi> firſt
touch one anothers Feet, then they ſet together their Knees, then their
Hands, then their Buttocks, then their Heads, then they imbrace one another,
and then 'tis a Marriage. If the Ceremonies or words of the Prieſt make
Marriage, then <hi>Nero</hi> was, when he was married to one
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch dreſſed like a Woman. And when another time
he married <hi>Sporus</hi> an Eunuch in <hi>Greece,</hi> theſe muſt be
Marriages: One ſaid it had been good for the World, <hi>Nero</hi>'s Father
had been ſo married.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Banaras,</hi> and amongſt other <hi>Indians,</hi>
when a Man and a Woman is to be Married, they and a <hi>Bramayne</hi> or
Prieſt, and a Cow with a Calf are brought together to the Rivers ſide. The
Woman having a Braſs-Pot in her hand full of Water; the Prieſt receiveth a
White Cloth of four Yards, and a Basket croſs bound with divers things in it;
the Cloth he layeth on the back of the Cow, and then he taketh the Cow by the
end of the Tail, and then he ſayes certain words, and the Man doth hold his
hand by the Prieſt's hand, and the Womans hand by her Husband's hand, and all
have the Cow by the Tail, and then they pour Water out of the Pot on the Cows
Tail, and it runneth through all their hands, and they lave up Water with their
hands, then the Prieſt ties them together by the Cloths, which done, they go
round about the Cow and Calf, give ſome Money to the Poor, and their Idol;
and leſt the man ſhould think himſelf married to the Cow and Calf, he
gives the Cow and Calf to the Prieſt, which is more then they give to the
Poor, and ſo they are Man and Wife; and whom the Cows Tail hath joined, let
no Man put aſunder, which if they do, 'twere fit the Prieſt loſt his Cow
and Calf. In <hi>Cambaia,</hi> as <hi>Texera</hi> reports, They have ſo great
eſteem of their Cows, that a Merchant <hi>Banyan</hi> ſpent 10 or 12
Thouſand Dukets in the Ceremony of a Nuptial Feaſt, of marrying his Cow to
his Friend's Bull, for the greater publication of it, not ſuffering it to be
private in the Woods; and what were the Cow or Calf the better for all this, or
who <pb n="130" facs="tcp:49347:73"/>could the ſooner know whether the Calf were the
legitimate Iſſue of the married Bull, or ſome other in the Woods.</p>

                  <p>THE debate of the lawfulneſs of the Marriage of
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> with Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> having been

<hi>Stephens,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fox</hi> met at <hi>Waltham</hi> one day at
Dinner, where falling in diſcourſe about the caſe, the other Doctors
thought the Marriage might be proved unlawful by the Civil-Law, but ſaid
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> It may better be proved unlawful by the Law of God: And ſo
it may be ſaid here, Marriage, Filiation, and Succeſſion, may be better
proved, as it is in truth, lawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, by the Moral-Law of God, then
by Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of Emperours, of Popes, of Biſhops,

                  <p>It will be ask't perhaps by ſome, In what Tables God hath
writ the Law of Nature, concerning <hi>Marriage, Filiation, Aliment,</hi> and
<hi>Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and how it may be read? To which I Anſwer, That the
Tables are of two kinds, the External, and Internal; and the Readers and
Witneſſes are of two kinds, the External, and Internal; the External Tables
of Marriage are expreſs'd by Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.4. when the
<hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> queſtion of Divorce, whether lawful for a man to put
away his Wife for every cauſe? <hi>He Anſwer'd, and ſaid unto them, have
ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning, made them Male and
Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male?</hi> The Male and Female are therefore the External and viſible
Tables, wherein God hath written in living <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> or
Figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Sexes, his Law of Marriage. As to External Tables, of
<hi>Filiation,</hi> Chriſt expreſſeth likewiſe the ſame,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 18.2. <hi>And Jeſus called a little Child unto him, and ſet
him in the midſt of them, and ſaid, Verely, I ſayunto you, Except ye be
converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
Kingdom of Heaven. Whoſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf as this
little Child, the ſame is greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven. And whoſo
ſhall receive one ſuch little Child in my name, receiveth me. But whoſo
ſhall offend <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49347:74"/>one of theſe little ones, it were better
for him that a Milſtone were hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Neck, and that he were drowned
in the depth of the Sea.</hi> As to the External Tables of <hi>Aliment,</hi>
they are expreſſed in his own Mother. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.27. <hi>Bleſſed
is the Womb that bare thee, and the Paps that thou haſt ſucked.</hi> The
Paps therefore wonderfully prepared to overflow with Milk, juſt againſt the
time the Child is to be born, are External Tables, wherein God hath written to
Innocents, in letters as white as Snow; that the Mother ought to aliment them
with the Milks of her Breaſts; And when he hath made the Teeth to break
through the Coral Gums, he writes in thoſe Ivory Tables, That the Father
ought to provide ſtronger meat for the Child. The Internal Tables are
expreſſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Written not with Ink,
but with the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in the
fleſhly Tables of the Heart.</hi> The Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Readers and Witneſſes are
all Creatures, as appears, <hi>Job</hi> 12.7. <hi>But ask now the Beaſts, and
they ſhall teach thee, and the Fowls of the Air, and they ſhall tell thee;
or ſpeak to the Earth, and it ſhall teach thee, and the Fiſhes of the Sea
and they ſhall declare unto thee.</hi> Go then and ask the Fowls of the Air
concerning <hi>Marriage, Filiation, Aliment</hi> and <hi>Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
they will ſhew thee their Mateing, their Pairing, keeping true Wedlock, their
private retirement to ſecret places, their holes, their Caves, their Neſts
they build for their young, their Males and Females who procreated them, and
not the Biſhops to be Judges to which they belong; their Grand-mother Earth
their dry-Nurſe, the Sea, their wet-Nurſe, Proviſion for them, all their
feeding, their ſucking their young, their teaching them when able, go to
their Grand-mother and take their Diet with her, and ſuch of them as have
Propriety in Goods and Chattels, Tenements and Haereditaments, as Bees, Ants,
and Squirrels, leaving as they die their Hives and Honey-Hills, and Corn-Holes,
and Nuts, to their Deſcendents, to be their Succeſſors. The Internal
Readers and Witneſſes in Man, are the Divine faculties of the Soul,
Senſe, and Reaſon, one doth Teſtifie the Fact, the other the Law. The
Internal Judg of the Probation of both, is the Conſcience. The Laws which
they read and teſtifie are written in the Internal Tables of the Heart,
Chriſt expreſſeth the firſt, concerning Marriage, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted
Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.5. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall a man leave Father and
Mother, and they two ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Concerning
<hi>Filiation,</hi> the Law of natural affection, which is writ in the heart of
the Father, is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>As the Father pittieth
his Children: ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him.</hi> And the Law of
natural affection writ in the heart of the Mother, is mention'd,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>Can a Woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſucking Child, that ſhe
ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her Womb?</hi> As to the Law of
<hi>Aliment</hi> written in the heart of the Father, it is mention'd,
<hi>Luke</hi> 11.11. <hi>If a Son ſhall ask bread of any of you that 
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49347:74"/>is a Father, will he give him a ſtone? or if he ask a
Fiſh, will he give him a Serpent? or if he ſhall ask an Egg, will he offer
him a Scorpion.</hi> Laſtly, as to the Law of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> written
in the heart of the Father, whereby all natural Sons ſucceeded, either to the
right of <hi>Primogeniture,</hi> or <hi>Filial Portions;</hi> the ſame runs
through all the examples of <hi>Jews</hi> in Scripture, and of
<hi>Gentiles</hi> in Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>This great Law of Nature is acknowledged to be written in the
Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Heart, by the Scripture it ſelf. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The
Gentiles who have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law:
theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the Law are a Law unto themſelves, which ſhew the work
of the Law written in their Hearts; their Conſcience alſo bearing
witneſs, and their thoughts, mean while, accuſing or excuſing one
another.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Women did ſin
againſt Nature:</hi> Yet was there no Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any Law
written by God or Man, in Paper and Ink, which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly prohibited them,
but only that of Nature. And that this Law of Nature can neither be changed,
nor aboliſhed, or diſpenſed with by any humane power, is agreed by
Philoſophers, Poets, Divines, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Civil Lawyers, and all others,
except Popes, who exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above God, Chriſt, and Nature, and all
that is called God. <hi>Lex Naturae, neo tolli, neo abrogari poteſt,</hi>

                     <head>Of the Final Cauſes of Marriage by the Law of God and
Nature.</head>
                     <p>The Final cauſes of Marriage, which is the Ordinance of
God, and not of Man, are not to fill Prieſts pockets with money, or to
ſatisfie their inſatiable Covetouſneſs, and Ambition; to ſet their
Foot on the Necks of Emperours and Kings, in their Legitimations, and
Succeſſions; and thereby to diſpoſe of the Kingdoms of Princes, and the
Liberty, Propriety, and Goods of the Subjects, at their Arbitrary will and
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But the Final cauſes of Marriage by the Law of God and Nature,
are three. 1. Procreation of Children. 2. That Man might have an Help-meet for
him, there being many neceſſities, eſpecially in time of ſickneſs,
wherein Man cannot be without the help of a Woman. 3. To make his life more
pleaſant and delightful, <hi>Triſtis ſine conjuge lectus.</hi> As for the
firſt part, which is the greateſt and chiefeſt end of Marriage, namely
procreation of Children; without which the World cannot be continued. To be the

                  <p>
                     <hi>They aſſume to be Judges,</hi> Jure Divino,
<hi>without a Sign of Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, which overthrows the Legiſlative
Power of King and Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they aſſume to be Angels and Meſſengers of God,
Embaſſadors of Chriſt, and Succeſſors by his laſt Will and
Teſtament, of the whole Power of Judgment given to the Son; yet do they
ſhew no ſign of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God, no letters of Credence from
Chriſt, nor any letters of Probat, that they were nominated either Executors
or Legatees in any ſuch <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49347:81"/>Teſtament, or in the
Teſtament of any Executor or Apoſtle of Chriſt; or in the Teſtament of
any Executor of ſuch Executors. But they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low therein the old Cheat of all
the old <hi>Pagan</hi> Legiſlators. Thus did the old <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
Prieſts call themſelves Angels of God, and were ſo called by the People;
and <hi>Menes,</hi> their moſt ancient Law-giver, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World,
alledged his Laws received from <hi>Mercury</hi> the <hi>Pagan Michael</hi> or
the Arch-Angel of the <hi>Meſſages</hi> of the gods. <hi>Minos</hi> the
Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator of <hi>Creet,</hi> to ſoar a pitch above the Authority of the
Laws of <hi>Menes,</hi> attributed his to <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf, and
alledged to the People, That the great God was his Gueſt in his Houſe for
the ſpace of Nine Years together, and Dined and Supped with him every day,
till he had indicted to him thoſe Divine Laws, and he was able to write them
for Publication. Thus did the <hi>Pope</hi> over-top that Law which was given
by the diſpoſition of Angels, by pretence of Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> whom he ſent to the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in a Cloak-bag.
And <hi>Mahomet</hi> to out-do the <hi>Pope,</hi> made himſelf the
<hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> affirming himſelf to be the Comforter promiſed by
Chriſt. <hi>John</hi> 14.25, 26. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you,
being yet preſent with you: but the Comforter, which is the Holy-Ghoſt,
whom the Father will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and
bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi>
Now the Biſhops pretend to a greater Power from Chriſt then
<hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> he only in this claims Power to Teach, but the Biſhops
claim Power <hi>Jure Divino</hi> from Chriſt, to Judg the World: yet whether
they ſhew any better Commiſſion or Miſſion then he, <hi>Jure
Divino,</hi> let any judg. The gift of Prophecy,<note place="margin">Prieſts
and Prophets at mortal Feud.</note> if true, goes not by Deſcent; thoſe who
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pretend to be Succeſſors, and call themſelves Prieſts, are
fain to counterfeit either a Law or Gift from the Predeceſſor's Prophet,
whereby the Prieſthood was made Hereditary or Succeſſive in that manner
by which they take it, yet both the old Prophet, and the new Prieſt, a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Prophet pretending a newer Revelation or Miſſion, again over-reaches and
deceives the deceivers, which is the reaſon that Prieſts pretending to be
Hereditary or Succeſſive, are always at mortal Feud with new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
true or falſe; the former who have no pretence but Poſſeſſion or a
Deſcent caſt, and a Poſſeſſary Action dreading to be Evicted by a

But ſuch patches of Eccleſiaſtical Policy are now worn ſo thread-bare
and full of holes, that ſince Grammar-Schools, Boys themſelves, peep
thorough and laugh to ſpie the Devil hid under the Pall of pretended <hi>Jure

<hi>Jure Divino</hi> above all Earthly Princes; and they ſhould have felt the
effect of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Excommunication to have been depoſed from their
Thrones, could he but have ſhewn a Divine Patent for the doing, as his
deluded followers firmly beleived he would do.</p>
                  <p>He was the Son of <hi>Mordecai Sevi</hi> an inhabitant of
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> who gained his living by being a Broker to an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant in that place; but his Son being addicted to
ſtudy, became to be a notable proficient in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue,
Divinity, and Metaphyſics; and vented ſuch new Doctrine in the Law of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> under the notion of being their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> ſo long
expected; as made the <hi>Jews</hi> forſake their Trades, and Negotiations

Diſciples were ſo numerous, as to be almoſt innumerable, there was one
<hi>Samuel Penya</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>Smyrna</hi> of good Eſtate and
Reputation, ſo much oppoſed him by arguments that he ſhewed not the
ſignes of Miſſion of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> according to Scripture and
the Doctrine of the Rabbi's; that he raiſed ſuch a Tumult againſt him, as
drove him out of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> with danger of his life. Yet being
ſeconded by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, this could not cruſh his Ambitious deſign: for
within a while after, his Enemy <hi>Penya</hi>'s Family were poſſeſs'd,
and his Daughter Propheſied, and fell into ſtrange extaſies: And this was
not done only in his Houſe, but four hundred Men and Women more, likewiſe
Propheſied of the growing Kingdom of <hi>Sabatai;</hi> and young Infants who
could ſcarce ſtammer out a ſyllable to their Mothers, repeat and
pronounce plainly the name of <hi>Sabatai</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and
Son of God; and voices were heard to ſound from their Stomach and Entrails;
and thoſe of riper years fell into Trances, foamed at Mouth, and by
inſpiration from the Devil, recounted the future Proſperity and deliverance
of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> their Viſions of the <hi>Lyon</hi> of
<hi>Judah,</hi> and the Triumph of <hi>Sabatai;</hi> which made <hi>Penya</hi>
Recant and turn Convert, and Preach more for him then <pb n="140" facs="tcp:49347:82"/>ever
he Preached againſt him. The noiſe of which Converſion of this
perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> to the faith, hugely increaſed the conflux of
multitudes to increaſe the Power of the Meſſiah, and nothing wanted now
but that <hi>Sabatai</hi> ſhould ſhew ſome Miracle for a Sign of his

heard any, beſides the Inſpirations which horribly puzled <hi>Sabatai,</hi>
though the imagination of the People was ſo vitiated, that any
<hi>Leigerdemane</hi>-Trick would have paſs'd with them for an high Miracle.
There happen'd an occaſion wherein <hi>Sabatai</hi> was to appear in behalf
of his Subjects before the <hi>Cadi</hi> or Judg of the City, to demand eaſe
and releif againſt ſome oppreſſions which greived them, it was thought
neceſſary the Miracle ſhould appear now or never, when <hi>Sabatai</hi>
appearing with a formal and Phariſaical Gravity which he had ſtarcht on,
ſome on the ſudden avouched to ſee a Pillar of Fire between him and the
<hi>Cadi,</hi> which report preſently run through the whole Room, and ſome
who ſtrongly fancied, vowed and ſwore they ſaw it; the alarm of the
Miracle ran likewiſe as ſpeedily through thoſe in the outer-yard, and was
likewiſe received at home by Wives and Children in a moment, and the then
Faith of this Miracle was ſo far rooted, that all thoſe who queſtion'd or
beleived it not, were called <hi>Kophrim,</hi> Infidels or Heritics, liable to
the cenſure of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with whom it was not lawful, as much as to

oppoſite to <hi>Seſtos.</hi> After he had been there a conſiderable time,
the noiſe of him flies louder to the ears of the Grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> and
he ſends a <hi>Chiaux</hi> or Meſſenger to bring ſpeedily
<hi>Sabatai</hi> to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he then was, whither he was
brought accordingly; and being demanded ſeveral queſtions in
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> by the Grand <hi>Seignior,</hi> he deſired a Doctor of
Phyſick, who had from a. <pb n="141" facs="tcp:49347:82"/>
                     <hi>Jew</hi> turn'd
<hi>Turk,</hi> to be his Interpreter, which was granted him, but not without
ſome reflexion of the ſtanders-by, <hi>That had he been the Meſſiah or
Son of God he would not have wanted Languages.</hi> Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come to
make Anſwer for himſelf in that way he could, the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi>
demanded a ſign of his Miſſion to be ſhewn by him of his
<hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah-ſhip,</hi> and would admit no other but a Miracle of his own
choice, which was, <hi>That</hi> Sabatai <hi>ſhould be ſtript naked, and
ſet as a mark to his Archers, if the Arrows paſſed not through his Body,
but his skin was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Proof, then would he beleive him to be the
Meſſiah.</hi> Here the Devil forſook <hi>Sabatai</hi> as he uſeth to do
Witches, when brought before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who beareth the Sword; for the
power of the Sword being a ſign of Miſſion to it ſelf, in regard the
Powers that are, are ordained by God, and leſſer Powers are commanded to be
ſubject to the greater. The Power of the Magiſtrate may be greater then
ſuch petty Daemons, as can only do ſuch Ape-tricks as Inſpirations or
Witchcraft; or if it is the roaring Lion himſelf, he may perhaps be afraid to
adventure on ſo many Troops of Hunters as the Magiſtrate can command; and
the Evil Spirit may not be in ſo high a degree Incorporeal, as not to be
liable to Corporeal-Force: but whether he be or be not, 'tis certain his
Inſtruments, <hi>Sabatais,</hi> Magicians and Witches are; and they are
therefore by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to be compell'd to ſhew a ſign of
Miſſion, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did, to call Fire from Heaven, which can
protect them; or the like againſt the Sword given by God to the Magiſtrate,
or elſe it is the duty of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to execute Juſtice upon them.
<hi>Sabatai</hi> therefore knowing he had no Spirit of God to protect him
againſt the Sword of God, in the hand of a Power, to the dreadful demand of
ſuch a ſign of Miſſion, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all his Titles to Kingdoms and
Governments, and humbly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that he was a poor <hi>Cocham</hi> and a
<hi>Jew</hi> as others were, and had nothing of Priviledg or Virtue above the
reſt: The Grand <hi>Seignior</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding not wholy ſatisfied
with this plain confeſſion, declared, <hi>That having given publick Scandal
to the Profeſſors of the</hi> Mahometan <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and done Diſhonour
to his Sovereign Authority, by pretending to draw-ſuch a conſiderable
portion from him under the pretence of the Kingdom of a Meſſiah, as</hi>
Palaeſtin; <hi>his Treaſon and Crime was not to be expiated by any other
means, then by a Converſion to the</hi> Mahometan <hi>Faith, which if he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do, the Stake was ready at the Gate of the</hi> Seraglio <hi>to
Impale him. Sabatai</hi> with much feigned cheerfulneſs replyed, <hi>That he
was contented to turn</hi> Turk, <hi>and that he did it not of force, but of
choice; and having been a long time deſirous of ſo glorious a
Profeſſion, he eſteemed himſelf much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd that he had the

The Meſſiah in whom the <hi>Jews</hi> had placed their Faith ſo high,
appearing not able to ſhew a ſign of Miſſion, and what was worſe,
turning <hi>Turk,</hi> they were extreamly confounded with <pb n="142" facs="tcp:49347:83"/>ſhame, which they might have prevented, had they as they ought to
have done, demanded the ſign effectually firſt. And if <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
who was the <hi>Muſſul-men</hi>'s Meſſiah, or the Popes, who are the
Catholics Meſſiahs, had in their beginnings but been put by Princes to
ſhew ſuch ſigns of Miſſion as <hi>Sabatai</hi> was by the Grand
<hi>Seignior,</hi> neither <hi>Mahometans,</hi> nor <hi>Popes,</hi> nor
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> nor ſo many Superſtitious Sects and Schiſmes could

                  <p>So <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.12. they tranſlated her young Woman, who

                  <p>The like falſity is likewiſe uſed in tranſlating 1

Women Princeſſes, and Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred young Women, and his Women turned away

Hundred to have been tranſlated Concubines, rather then the Three Hundred; if
it be ſaid Riches and Portions make Wives, and Poverty Concubines, or
Jointures and Dowers make Wives, and none make Concubines, this is contrary to
what Chriſt ſaith of Marriage, That it is of ſuch as God hath joined in
one fleſh, and not whom Scriveners and Lawyers have joined in one Indenture.
Then as to Poverty, none will deny a poor Wife to be as true a Wife as a rich:
and many think her in goodneſs, far ſuperior, for <hi>intolerabilius nihil

the Man who gives Jointures to hire the Wife, ſuch a Woman ſo hired, may
indeed be rather ſaid a Concubine then a Wife; and ſuch a Man ſo hired,
be rather ſaid a Stallion then a Husband, and ſuch a Mercenary Conjunction
be rather called a Market then a Marriage.</p>
                  <p>To return again to the Tranſlation, it is tranſlated,
<hi>That his Wives drew away his heart,</hi> but it is more likely the young
Women, who are tranſlated Concubines drew away his heart, then old Wives;
whereas <pb n="145" facs="tcp:49347:84"/>if it had been tranſlated as it ought to be,
<hi>his Women drew away his heart,</hi> which word includes both Wives and

Etymologies, they derive Baſtard from <hi>Baſſaris,</hi> which they ſay
ſignifies <hi>Meretrix.</hi> (1.) What is this to the purpoſe to prove
<hi>Nothus</hi> a Baſtard? (2.) It is denyed that <hi>Baſſaris</hi>

<hi>Solomon Prov.</hi> 7.11. ſaith, <hi>Her Feet abide not in the Houſe:
Now ſhe is without, now in the ſtreets,</hi> which ſhe ws ſhe is a

Money, then from Wine; for <hi>Meretrix dicitur à <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49347:86"/>Merendo,</hi> from letting her ſelf to hire for Money or Reward, and
this as well agrees with <hi>My honey,</hi> as <hi>Money;</hi> for

that <hi>Venus</hi> came from <hi>Baſsaris,</hi> and that <hi>Cupid</hi> is
in <hi>Hebrew Mamzer,</hi> and in <hi>Greek Nothus,</hi> and that therefore
<hi>Mamzer</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> do ſignifie Baſtard, which is to infer

amongſt them; and for Marriage in a Temple, they never had any at all, but
always contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the open Air, and not under any Roof. And both they, and
all other Nations, have had ſo honourable opinions of Giants, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>But the moſt vertuous and valiant <hi>Hippolitus</hi>
remaining invincible in Chaſtity, as to his Step-mother, and in Loyalty as to
his Father; ſhe, as <hi>Potiphar's</hi> Wife did <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to her
Husband falſly accuſed him of attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to force her; which he
over-credulous to believe, ſought to kill his Son. And he flying his Father's
jealouſie, and cauſleſs anger, had by his frighted Horſes, his Chariot
overthrown, and himſelf torn to pieces amongſt the Rocks. So infortunate
was innocence in all things, except his Fame, which hath laſted through ſo
many Ages. His Father on <hi>Phaedra's</hi> confeſſion, underſtanding the
Innocence of his Son, and falſeneſs of her calumny, ſhe firſt killing
her ſelf, after the juſt Funeral Rites perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Lamentation
anſwerable made, is ſwallowed up with grief, for the loſs of a Son ſo
dearly by him beloved. Here therefore appears, That had it not been for the
falſe calumnies of his Step-mother, <hi>Hippolitus</hi> had ſucceeded to
his Father <hi>Theſeus</hi>'s Kingdom; notwithſtanding his Mother 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49347:88"/>
                     <hi>Hippolita</hi> had not a Torch carried before her, nor
was ever married by the Ceremonies of a Prieſt in a Temple: wherein though
<hi>Grotius</hi> need no other anſwer to his Ceremonial Marriage, then what
in this example he thought to vouch for them, and his principal
<hi>Goliah</hi>-argument being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, there need no trouble of encountring
the petty acceſſary Reaſons: Yet I ſhall likewiſe perſue them in
their flight, at leaſt to diſcover what they are.</p>
                  <p>His firſt reaſon is, he ſaith, Where the Father doth not
vouchſafe the Woman the Lawful Ceremonies of Marriage, he makes the Child
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to be his Succeſſor.</p>
                  <p>To which is anſwer'd, That we need look no further then his
own example, whether <hi>Hippolitus</hi> was a perſon contemptible, or not,
meriting in all reſpects to ſucceed to his Father's Kingdom after his
Death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is further anſwer'd, That theſe Ceremonies
whereon he founds his Doctrin of Ceremonial Marriage, and the compulſion to
the ſame, are before ſhewen to come from the Devil, and the Prieſts of
<hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and in imitation of them from Popery.
Therefore in ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms as are Proteſtant, and not Pagan or Popiſh,
though there may be a toleration given to ſuch as deſire to marry with a
Torch, or any other public Ceremonies ſuiting with their Conſcience and
Convenience; yet ought not there to be compulſion of Diſſentients, either
in Conſcience or Convenience; nor ſo impious a puniſhment as
Illegitimation laid on the innocent Child, for ſuch Toys as Ceremonies
neglected or diſſented to by the Parents.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is greater authority in point, then either

hate the Mother, ought not to illegitimate the Child, as to Succeſſion, as
appears, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.15. <hi>If a Man have two Wives, one beloved, and
the other hated, and they have born him Children, both the beloved and the
hated; and the firſt-born Son be hers that was hated: Then it ſhall be when
he makes his Sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the Son
of the beloved firſt-born, before the Son of the hated, who is indeed the
firſt-born; but he ſhall acknowledg the Son of the hated for the
firſt-born, in giving him a double Portion of all be hath; for he is the
beginning of his ſtrength, and the right of the firſt-born is his.</hi>

                  <p>The Reaſons given by <hi>Skene,</hi> why <hi>Nothus</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he ſaith, Baſtards are commonly got and
procreat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Women, who are in <hi>Greek</hi> called
<hi>Baſſaris.</hi> As to the Etymology, 'tis anſwer'd before, as to the
matter of the Children of Common Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, 'tis deny'd that they have commonly
any Children at all; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they make themſelves barren by ſome wicked

                  <p>According to which, we do not hear of <hi>Lais, Thais, Phryne,
Flora,</hi> or others, who are famous or rather infamous at the Trade, to have
had any Children at all; which was one cauſe that <hi>Flora</hi> made the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth her Heir. And we ſee by experience, that the Children born, as
they call it, out of Wedlock, are, for the greateſt part, of ſuch as have
kept themſelves chaſt to one Man; yea more chaſt then many Wives, who
have been coupled to the Husbands by a Prieſt in a Temple, or a Juſtice of
Peace in his Hall. And further in Nature, the too thick ſowing of the field,
and the too ſoon plowing after ſowing deſtroyes the Harveſt: So in
greateſt probability, ſuch a Woman as hath a Child, ought to be preſumed
ſhe hath not been common, and the Child cannot be here <hi>filius
populi;</hi> but his Father is better known then of the Children of a Woman
married by the Prieſt in a Temple, though the Husband hath been always within
the four Seas.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſays, <hi>Nothia</hi> ſignifies by the
<hi>Athenian</hi> Law a Portion given to a Child not born within Wedlock, which
was not to exceed <hi>Mille Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae; ergo Nothos</hi> ſignifies a
Baſtard. <hi>Negatur ſequela;</hi> For the Child which he himſelf makes a
Baſtard, he ſays, cannot be Heir or Succeſſor to any; which is, he
cannot be Succeſſor Teſtamentory or otherwiſe to any filial Portion at
all; which the <hi>Athenian</hi> Law did ſuffer him to be, ſo it exceeded
not the value of <hi>Mille Drachmae.</hi> And further <hi>Reg. Majeſt.</hi>
cited by him, ſaith, <hi>a Baſtard can neither be Heir, or ſucced to the
Lands or Goods of the Parents, nor the Parents to him:</hi> A moſt inhuman
Law, and ſubverting the courſe of Nature, which the <hi>Athenian</hi> was
not. And what was the end of this Epiſcopal cruelty, of taking away the
inheritance of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from the Child, and of the Child from the Parents;
but that they themſelves might be Succeſſors to his movables, and if he
bought not of them for money his Legitimation, then they might forfeit all was
left to the King; not out of any good will they bore to the King, but to force
the parties, Parents and Children, to pay them what they pleaſed, or <hi>quod

Blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, and Treaſon againſt their Princes; to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſucceeded not to the inheritance, but had a Portion.</hi> As to
<hi>Iſmael</hi>'s being a Baſtard, it is falſe, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Text
of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.3. which expreſly ſaith, Agar <hi>his Mother
was</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Wife.</hi> If his Mother therefore we <hi>Abraham</hi>'s

himſelf affirms before, that a Baſtard is got of a Common Woman.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s giving him a filial Portion, and
the Sons of <hi>Keturah</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their filial Portions, is an
acknowledgment and not a diſ-acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of them to be his Sons:
Therefore though he excluded them from the inheritance, he doth not intend
thereby to make them Baſtards, for it was the <hi>Patria poteſtas</hi> of
every Father, then, to diſpoſe of his own Eſtate how he pleaſed, and to
thoſe who pleaſed him beſt, and might give the inheritance from the
eldeſt if he thought fit; till after reſtrained by the Law of
Primogeniture, to give him a double Portion.</p>

without better reaſons, or a better Sword to argue it againſt the

                  <p n="6">6. Other reaſons have been made likewiſe, in behalf
of the Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Legitimation of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> which ſhew him
to have been no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard: as firſt, That the Marriage between
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> being Brother and Siſter, was
Inceſtuous, and therefore the Marriage with <hi>Agar</hi> more Lawful then
hers. Next, that uncertainty of Filiation was more in <hi>Iſacc</hi> then in
<hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> had better probation of himſelf to
be the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> then <hi>Iſaac</hi> had, for <hi>Agar</hi> was
kept in perpetual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of her Husband, from the time of his begetting, to

<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> having iſſue, a Son by one

by the Father's ſide (for ſhe was born of the former <hi>Venter</hi>) being
then living, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther took the Adminiſtration of her Son's Goods, by the

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49347:89"/>being thus granted to the Mother; the Siſter by th

pretending her ſelf to be next of kin, and the Mother not to be kin at all to
the party Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and therefore deſireth the Adminiſtration, formerly
granted the Mother, to be revoked, and committed to her, as next kin to the
Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by force of the ſaid Statute. Hereupon the moſt Learned, as
well in the Laws of the Realm as in the Civil Law, were conſulted; and both
Common Lawyers and Civilians, unanimouſly declared it to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of
their Faith, contrary to Scripture and common ſence, that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not
kin to her Son; ſo Judgment was paſs'd againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby ſhe
loſt her Son and her money too, perhaps ſome that ſhe gave him. And in
thoſe days this precedent did ſo much prevail, that many other Judgments
paſſed accordingly againſt the Mothers. Then <hi>in</hi> Rama <hi>was

affection, covenant to ſtand ſeized of ſuch a piece of Land, to the uſe
of his Son; this natural affection is a ſufficient conſideration to raiſe
an Uſe, as they call it, and to veſt the Eſtate in the Son, though he

reputed Father within the four Seas. But if the Son be his true natural Son,
begotten by himſelf, then the conſideration of natural affection to his
true Son, is no conſideration to raiſe an Uſe, nor to paſs the Land to
him, but the ſame is void and null. In the firſt Caſe, where there is no
ground for natural affection, they talk all of nature, extolling her above all
conſiderations, and cry out <hi>Naturae vis maxima,</hi> and <hi>Natura bis

Many ways of counterfeiting Sons have been uſed, (1.) When the Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Barren, to pleaſe her Husband feigns a great Belly and a Delivery, and
preſents him with a ſuppoſitious Child inſtead of her own; ſo is it
related of <hi>Algive</hi> the Wife of <hi>Canutus,</hi> that ſhe brought him
ſuch a Child, whom he called <hi>Sweyne,</hi> and afterward made him King of
<hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> and many other examples have been of the like. (2.) When the
Perſon who would make himſelf Son deceives the Father; ſo
<hi>Iſaac</hi> being blind, <hi>Jacob</hi> putting on Kids-skin-Gloves, the
hair left on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the old man to beleive him his true eldeſt Son who was
but a counterfeit. And I my ſelf knew a Woman in time of the Wars, who having
two Sons, the Elder was Twenty Years before ſent beyond Sea, and died there,
whereby the younger had the Land of his Father ſettled upon him, but at
length the Soldiers in their marches paſſing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, one amongſt
them of the like Age and Feature as was the Eldeſt <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49347:91"/>Son
of the Woman, who Twenty Years before died beyond Sea, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in the
Pariſh where the Woman lived, and being informed by ſome of the Houſe
where he Quarter'd, how like he was to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thereupon enquiring
out as many particular paſſages as he could, which had paſſed between
the Woman and her Son, and others, and what particular marks the Eldeſt Son
had, the Soldier went to the Woman's Houſe enquiring for his Father and
Mother, whoſe bleſſing he asked, and they being thereat much ſurprized,
he told them he was their Eldeſt Son, and what Fortunes Providence had
carried him thorough to bring him home again: at which the doubtful Parents
examin'd him, and askt him many queſtions to try whether he were their very
Son <hi>Eſau</hi> or not, and took more time, and the Woman likewiſe
examin'd him in private by her ſelf, but he at laſt ſo perſuaded the
Woman, that ſhe beleived, and affectionately received him for her Eldeſt
Son who had been thought ſo long dead, till at length the younger Brother who
fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be again diſinherited of what was ſettled on him, with much ado
diſcover'd the counterfeit. (3.) When the Mother is Deliver'd of a true Son,
and a changling is brought home by the Nurſe or other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice inſtead of
the true. (4.) When the Father having no natural Son, adopts a Son begotten by
another Father; ſo did <hi>Claudius</hi> adopt <hi>Nero,</hi> and many other
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and many Perſons of private Families, having
no Son of their own, convey and ſettle their Names, Titles, Arms, and Lands,

<hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> nor <hi>Legitimation,</hi> nor
<hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> can make theſe true, or natural, or lawful

are teſtified to be natural Sons by falſe Witneſſes, which is often
practiſed in the Biſhips Courts, ſuch are counterfeit Sons. (6.) When
ſuch as are not natural Sons, are teſtified Sons by the Biſhops

                        </gap> it is manifeſt

<hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s and <hi>Pope</hi>'s Heads were hot with their Civil or

the ſignification of what it is made ſince of a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>Vocabulum

impoſſible for the Chriſtians of thoſe times to underſtand, or how to
reconcile the variant and contradictory expoſitions, would in the later days
be for gain made on the ſame. Some make <hi>Nothi</hi> and <hi>Flii

<hi>And the Earth helped the Woman, and the Earth opened her mouth, and

                     <p>Now though none here undertake to unfold Myſteries, or

                     <p>Sixthly, To ſhew that <hi>Coke</hi> needs no other to

made, and directed to Sheriffs and others, to Arreſt ſuch as ſhould be
Certified into the</hi> Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>by the Biſhops and Prelates, Maſters
of Divinity, to be Preachers of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and notorious Errors, their
Fautors, Maintainers, and Abetters, and to hold them in ſtrong Priſon,
until they will juſtifie themſelves to the Law of the Holy Church.</hi> By
colour of this ſuppoſed Act certain Perſons that held Images were not to
be worſhip'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were holden in ſtrong Priſon, until they
(to redeem their vexation) miſerably yielded before theſe Maſters of
Divinity to take an Oath, and did ſwear to worſhip Images, which was
againſt the Moral and Eternal Law of Almighty God. We have ſaid (by colour
of the ſuppoſed Statute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) not only in reſpect of the
ſaid Opinion, but in reſpect alſo, that the ſaid ſuppoſed Act, was
in truth never any Act of Parliament, though it was Entred in the Rolls of
Parliament; for that the Commons never gave their conſent thereunto. And
therefore in the next Parliament, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons prefer'd a Bill reciting the
ſaid ſuppoſed Act, and conſtantly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they never
aſſented thereto, and therefore deſired that the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Statute
might be aniented, and declared void. For they proteſted, that it was never
their intent to be juſtified, and to bind themſelves and their
Succeſſors to Prelates, more then their Anceſtors had done in times
paſt: And hereunto the King gave his Royal Aſſent in theſe words,
<hi>Ypleiſt au Roy.</hi> And mark well the manner of the penning the Act: for
ſeeing the Commons did not aſſent thereunto, the words of the Act are,
<hi>It is Ordained and Aſſented in this preſent Parliament, That,</hi>
&amp;c. And ſo it was, being but by the King and the Lords.</p>
                  <p>It is to be known, that of ancient time, when any Acts of
Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were made, to the end the ſame might be publiſhed, and

came into <hi>England,</hi> the Acts of Parliament were ingroſſed into

ſometime in <hi>French,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Sheriff to proclaim the ſaid
Statutes within his Bailwick, as well within Liberties, as without. And this

and without any inquiſition after them, that all they are guilty of are not

That it is impoſſible to exclude Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Papiſts from Printing, they

with far greater advantage vent their matters, then from any Preſſes in

Uncleanneſs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enemy or Friend will ſo far diſhonour themſelves,
or their Cauſe, as to Print them openly, for it is againſt their

deſire to know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, wherein the ſtrength of his Cauſe, as well as
of his Forces lies; and to have the War Proclaimed in Print before it begin,
that he may the better provide againſt. Beſides, if there were but a Law
made, that nothing ſhall be printed, without the names of the Author and
Printer, with their Additions and Deſignations: And that all Crimes againſt
the publick, committed by Printing, ſhould be puniſhed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
according to Law; and all injuries to private perſons, ſhould be reparable
by the parties injured, on their Actions according to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: Who would dare
make himſelf guilty of a publick Crime, or private Injury in Print, to which
he had ſet his name?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to matters of Hereſie, ſuch as by accident
become dangerous to public ſafety, the prudence of the Legiſlators, may,
where they find cauſe, prohibit them, both Preſs and Pulpit; but not in the
Thoughts and Conſciences of Men: As in the end of the Wars of
<hi>Germany,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> it
was Enacted, mutually on both ſides on pain of death, <hi>That no</hi>

or</hi> Lutheran <hi>againſt the</hi> Catholick; <hi>but both ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the liberty of their own Conſciences to themſelves.</hi> This agreement was
here made, otherwiſe thoſe bloody Wars would never have ended, without a
total deſtruction of one of the Parties.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe ſuch a Law were here much more neceſſary,
between diſſentient Proteſtants, who were Brethren, then it was between
the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> and <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who were mortal Enemies; That
no diſſentient <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſhould Print or Preach publickly, on
any point of Ceremonial diſſentiency, or other matter not neceſſary to
Salvation, except in ſuch matters as are particularly allowed by Supream
Authority, to exclude Popery; there being Field-room enough in the Moral Law of
God, to exerciſe gifts in Preaching; and matters which have the promiſe of
this life, and of that to come; and no cauſe for any to complain, who have
liberty likewiſe of Conſcience to uſe what <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Ceremonies, and Form of Worſhip they will to themſelves, though they have
not power to compel the Conſciences of others, who are diſſentients. But
if <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are tolerated to Print or Preach againſt one
another, this is the thing the Papiſt would have, and knows will in the end
make them. both a prey to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But though <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ought not to preach one
againſt another, yet the juncture of Affairs being not at preſent in great
<hi>Britain,</hi> as before <pb n="166" facs="tcp:49347:95"/>mention'd in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and an appearance of War Plotted by the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> rather to begin than
end with the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> the Biſhops ought not to be ſuffer'd to
interdict either Preſs or Pulpit to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt
them.</p>
                  <p>To come at length to the further miſchiefs inſuing the
Interdiction of the Preſs; any Interdiction of the Preſs (except in Caſes
before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) either to Friend or Enemy, is a diſhonour to the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as if it dared not ſuffer it ſelf to be
diſputed, or to meet an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the open field; whereas in truth, it is not
<hi>Proteſtancy</hi> but <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> 'Tis not the Moral Law which
is the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Law, but the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial which is the
<hi>Popiſh</hi> Law, which dares not encounter the ſhock of an Enemy: And
'tis Fiction and not Truth, Vice and not Vertue, which fears either Preſs or
Paſquil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Foreign Preſſes being impoſſible to be
interdicted to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are
interdicted to the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> he is thereby ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, and
prohibited to anſwer the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> let him preach what he
pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By Interdiction, the profit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Proteſtant Print-houſes will be tranſported to Foreign Papiſts; which
will be a great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſo neceſſary a Trade in
<hi>England,</hi> and prejudice to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and Policy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Interdiction of the Preſs will multiply the
greater evil of Libels and Lampoons.</p>
                  <p>It increaſes unlearned Sects and Hereſies, who if drawn to
Print would either not be able to form their Doctrine in Principles or
Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or if they were, they would appear ſo abſurd as would be fit
to imploy boys to laugh at, rather than Doctors to confute: Such were
<hi>Mahomet</hi>'s, whoſe <hi>Alchoran</hi> is not therefore ſuffered to be
Printed, or Tranſlated.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It cauſes the more dangerous way of ſpreading
Hereſies, both learned and unlearned, to be neglected how to prevent, which
is the ſecret creeping into private Houſes, leading Captive ſilly Women,
with whom they walk like the Peſtilence in the dark; whereas if they
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Print or publick Preaching, they might be known where they are,
and oppoſed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſtops the truth of all intelligence, which is
ſo invaluable a Treaſure, and difficult to be got into the Gates of
Princes.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A free Preſs is the pulſe of the Body politic,
from which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the wiſeſt State-Phyſician to
diſcern, or prevent the public Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, unleſs it is ſuffer'd to
beat free without a Ligature.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It ſtops all juſt cauſes of complaint, and
appeal of the Subject to the King and Parliament, againſt Judges and great
Officers, both Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal. It was my own ill fortune to be prickt
Sheriff <pb n="167" facs="tcp:49347:95"/>of a County, which enforced me to draw a Petition
to be preſented to the King and Parliament; deſiring ſome remedy
againſt the old Popiſh Oath, continued to be impoſed on Sheriffs; wherein
they ſwear to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, under the name of
<hi>Lollary;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be relieved againſt the extortions of
Officers of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> on Sheriffs: which not knowing how
otherwiſe conveniently to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, I appointed the Meſſenger to get a
Licenſe to Print; which he tryed to do, but though there was nothing in it
but Humility and Truth; as who dare preſent otherwiſe to the Legiſlative
Power? The Licenſer Swore <hi>He would not Licenſe it for Five Hundred
Guinneys,</hi> whereby it could not be done.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It ſtops all preſentments by the People to the
King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of public grievances, in regard the extent of the Three
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms is great, and remote; and therefore neither fit nor poſſible,
multitudes ſhould come ſo far to preſent Petitions in perſon; and if
not done in perſon, there are ſo many Papiſts, and Foreign Agents, and
their favourers in the way, as may, and do often intercept from the King's
knowledg, the humble applications of his Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as is eaſie
to do, when perhaps compriſed only in one ſheet of Paper. To avoid
therefore the ſtifling of all juſt complaints of the Subjects, and the ill
conſequences which have been too often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned thereby, of preſenting
Petitions by Tumults and Armies: It is far more ſafe and equal, that the
Preſs ſhould be open to the People in all public Addreſſes to Supream
Authority; it being many times a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſatisfaction to them, if they
underſtand that the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do but vouchſafe to hear their
complaints and deſires, though they think it not fit to grant them: And a
Child will often times awe his Enemies from harming him, if he do but threaten
them he will tell his Father, where they know he hath that liberty given
him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It appears by experience, That the Liberty of the
Preſs in <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Foreign States, where permitted, not
only bring no inconveniences, but very great benefits and advantages to the
People.</p>

here only to contend with them; but in all other matters of Oppreſſion of
the Conſciences, and Rights of the Subjects both as to Religion, Liberty and
Propriety, as high as ever the Pope did; though never any ſuch Supremacy was

what hath before been, or lawfully may be exerciſed or uſed, (ſo the word

ſufficiently proved before againſt my Lord <hi>Coke</hi>'s

Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy no higher than the Temporal Supremacy, which every
one knows in all Acts of Legiſlation, is joyntly in the King and Parliament,

exerciſe no Supremacy from one, unleſs they have it from both; nor of any

                  <p>Coronation is the Inveſtiture of a King in his Kingdom, by

Inveſtiture of a Biſhop, by Tradition, of a Ring and Staff or Croſyer;
and of a Soldier in Feudal Tenures, by Tradition of a Ring, Sword, or
Spear.</p>
                  <p>The Perſons who have uſed to make Traditions of Crowns,
have been in Kingdoms where the Prieſt hath the Supremacy of the King; as in
<hi>Pagan</hi> Kingdoms by the High Prieſt, and in <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Kingdoms by the Pope or Biſhop; and in <hi>Germany</hi> by both; for the King
of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> is uſed to receive three Crowns, one of Iron, another
of Silver, and another of Gold. That of Iron he receives of the Biſhop of
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn</hi> in <hi>Aquiſgrave;</hi> that of Silver of the Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Millayne</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the ſame City, and in the Church
of St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> That of Gold, of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in
the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> at the Altar of St. <hi>Maurice.</hi> Where
Note, That Gold may be bought too dear, <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49347:97"/>and that three
Magpies have got by the Bargain Supremacy over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Eagle.</p>
                  <p>But in ſuch Kingdoms where the Supremacy hath been in the
King above the Prieſt, the Tradition of the Crown hath been by the People or
their Repreſentative, which we call here a Parliament, or one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by
them, in regard a multitude cannot all do it in perſon.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe to be obſerved, That there is a difference
between aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a Kingdom by Conqueſt, and by Contract; for he that
comes in by Conqueſt, takes the Crown without Tradition from Clergy or Lay,
whether they will or no, or exerciſes the Power of the Sword to govern at his
Will without a Crown, as did the old <hi>Roman,</hi> and now do the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors, who are never Crowned, but wear Turbans, whereby no
Foreign Caliphs, nor their own Mufti's can uſurp Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Supremacy: for whoſoever accepts Tradition of a Crown, or any other Symbol or
token of Inveſtiture, lays aſide all Titles by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and receives a
Kingdom by Contract with the people, and takes an Oath to Govern according to
the Laws Contracted; which Contract if made with Biſhops, and they have the
Power of Tradition of the Crown, (if we will believe <hi>Henry</hi> the Second)
they will impoſe their own Terms of Supremacy and every thing elſe which
concerns their profit; and how Imperious they have been in arrogating to
themſelves only the Right of Tradition of the Crown, I ſhall only mention
one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, who after the death of
his firſt Queen <hi>Matild,</hi> married a ſecond called <hi>Adelira;</hi>
and when ſhe was to Be Crowned, <hi>Ralf,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> who was to do the Office, came to King <hi>Henry</hi>
ſitting in his Chair of State, asking <hi>who had ſet the Crown on his
Head?</hi> The King anſwering, <hi>I have now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, it was ſo long
ſince. Well,</hi> ſays the Arch-Biſhop, <hi>who ever did it, he did me
wrong, to whom it belonged, and as long as you hold it thus, I will do no

inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of an Arch-Biſhop.</note> 
                     <hi>Do what you think good.</hi>
Whereupon the Arch-Biſhop took the Crown off the King's Head, and after, at
the intreaty of the people, ſet it on again, and then proceeded to Crown the
Queen. Here appears a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Tradition of the Crown by a
Biſhop, and by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for the Biſhop arrogates the Right, as the Pope
by his Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy, and compels the Prince
implicity to acknowledg the ſame, by either receiving the Original Tradition,
or Confirmation of his Crown from him, as one that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

where it is received from the People or Parliament, neither Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity nor
Supremacy is imply'd, nor comes in queſtion, but only the form of the
Contract; for Superiors, and Inferiors, and Equals, may all Contract alike, and

pretence of Conſecration of Crowns and Oils, by which the Pope firſt, and
ſince the Biſhop, hath uſurped Supremacy over Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſecretly
ſteal the Supremacy of that Spiritual Juriſdiction to themſelves, which
they pretend to give them. But where the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Crown or Unction is
by the People or their Repreſentative the Parliament, according to Contract
between them and the Prince, they never pretend any ſuch thing as
Conſecration in either, but a civil Contract obliged by mutual Oaths.</p>
                  <p>To ſhew ſome farther Authority, therefore, that never any
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Ralf</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or other
Biſhop, had any Authority from Chriſt in the New, or the Prophets or
Prieſts in the Old Teſtament, to make Tradition of a Crown to any Temporal
Prince, but the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the People or their Repreſentative, who
were to be Subjects: It is evident, (1.) as to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 18.36.
<hi>His Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> (2.) He never had any Crown but that
of Thorns, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.29. Nor any Robes but the ſeamleſs Coat,
<hi>John</hi> 19.23. As to the Prophets and Prieſts in the Old Teſtament,
they never made Tradition of any Crown to any King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or
<hi>Judah,</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from the People, (ſuch as wore them)
and not from any Prophet or Prieſt; for though <hi>Nunrod,</hi> as is already
mention'd, alledged or feigned before his Uſurpation of the firſt Monarchy,
that God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him miraculouſly a Crown in the Clouds, and
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> likewiſe alledged or feigned, that God ſhewed him
miraculouſly a Croſs in the Clouds, yet never any material Crown or Croſs
dropt from the Clouds, neither doth it appear in Scripture, or any Hiſtory,
that any material Crown was ever by Miracle made by God, or ſent by any
Prophet or Prieſt, who ſhould have Authority to make Tradition thereof, and
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <pb n="172" facs="tcp:49347:98"/>give Inveſtiture of a Kingdom, nor Robes; for
though, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. <hi>God made Coats of Skins and clothed</hi> Adam;
and <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.30. <hi>clothed the Lillies,</hi> yet it is before
ſaid, <hi>Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe:</hi>
Which ſhews, though God made the Lillies, he made not <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Robes. And the Prophet <hi>Ahijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.30. though he
propheſied the Kingdom to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> gave him neither Crown nor
Robes, but rather diſrobed him; <hi>for he caught his new Garment he bad on,
and rent it in twelve pieces, and gave him ten of them.</hi> And they were the
People only that gave him the Inveſtiture by Crown and Robes, if thoſe
Ceremonies were at all uſed; for it is ſaid, <hi>Cap.</hi> 12.20. <hi>The
People ſent and called him unto the Congregation, and made him King over
all</hi> Iſrael: <hi>there was none that followed the Houſe of</hi> David,
<hi>but the Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>only.</hi> And <hi>Verſe</hi> 24. It
appears, that this was from God; yet were not the Prieſts hand in it to Crown
him, for they would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Sacrifice at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
which, <hi>Verſe</hi> 27. made <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to fear, that if the people
ſhould go thither to ſacrifice, they would again return to
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and cauſed him, for prevention, to ſet up the two Golden
Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> As to the Coronation of
<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> we find <hi>Saul</hi> had a Crown, for, the
<hi>Amalekite</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10. who tells <hi>David</hi> he ſlew

that <hi>Samuel</hi> gave him this Crown, neither is it probable; for as hath
been ſaid before, it appears not in any Hiſtory, that God ever ſent a
material Crown by any Prophet; and as to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts
Cuſtom they could have none, <hi>Saul</hi> being the firſt King in that
Kingdom; and Law they could have none for the Prieſt to make Tradition of the
Crown to the King, for <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions no ſuch thing: therefore it
was done by the People, who were of neceſſity to ſhew their aſſent
and acknowledgment, by ſome external Ceremony of acknowledgment of their
Governor, which after the manner of the Nations, after whoſe example they
deſired to have a King, was by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Crown, and bringing him
Preſents; which Preſents ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. to be made by the

aſſumed the Crown himſelf with his own hand, nor received Tradition or
Inveſtiture of any Prophet or Prieſt of the ſame, but from the People, on
Contracts mutually agreed. Yea not only the Crown, but the Anointing it ſelf;
which ſignified the Kingdoms, was given by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; or, which is all one,
by their Repreſentative in Parliament, and not by the Prieſt, as will
appear from the Texts following, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16, 13. where it
is ſaid concerning <hi>David,</hi> when he was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Samuel,
Then</hi> Samuel <hi>took the Horn of Oil, and anointed him in the midſt of
his Brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came on</hi> David <hi>from that day

<hi>Sam.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Then came all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to</hi>

<hi>made a League with them in</hi> Hebron <hi>before the Lord: and they

<hi>Then all</hi> Iſrael <hi>gather'd themſelves to</hi> David
<hi>unto</hi> Hebron: And <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. <hi>Therefore came all the Elders
of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to the King to</hi> Hebron, <hi>and</hi> David <hi>made a

David <hi>King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>according to the word of the Lord
by</hi> Samuel.</p>
                  <p>By which appears firſt, that the anointing by
<hi>Samuel</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> gave him no Inveſtiture of the Kingdom;
for <hi>Saul</hi> was then alive, but only he propheſied by this he ſhould
be King, and Succeſſor after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death, and by Miracle prepared
and made him capable and fit to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Office, by giving him from that
time the Spirit of God; which Miracle likewiſe followed the anointing of his

<hi>Verſe.</hi> But there is no ſuch Miracle enſues from Epiſcopal

Eſpous'd and took to Wife <hi>Elizabeth Beckwith:</hi> And after,
<hi>Anno</hi> 5th. <hi>Eliz.</hi> before certain Commiſſioners
Eccleſiaſtical, the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth Beckwith</hi> Libelled againſt
the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kenne,</hi> That before the Marriage between them

was awarded againſt <hi>Elizabeth Stowell pro intereſſe.</hi> And upon
due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Cauſe, it was Sentenced, That the Marriage between
the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kenne,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth Beckwith,</hi> was
lawful, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced them <hi>ad Exequenda Conjugalta obſequia,</hi>
&amp;c. And that the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kenne</hi> was never lawfully
Eſpouſed unto the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth Stowell;</hi> and after the ſaid
<hi>Elizabeth Beckwith</hi> died, after whoſe death the ſaid
<hi>Chriſtopher</hi> took to Wife the ſaid <hi>Florence,</hi> by whom he
had Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue one Daughter, and called <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and died. And
<hi>Anno</hi> 36th. <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was found by Office in the County of
<hi>Sommerſet,</hi> by Force of a <hi>Mandamus,</hi> after the death of the
ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kenne,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Elizabeth Kenne</hi>
was his Daughter and Heir, who was within Age, <hi>Viz.</hi> of the Age of Ten
Months. The Queen granted her Wardſhip to Sir <hi>Nicholas Stallenge</hi> and
the ſaid <hi>Florence</hi> then his Wife, on which the ſaid <hi>Martha</hi>
alledged her ſelf to be Daughter and Heir to the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher
Kenne,</hi> and with her Husband <hi>Silveſter Williams,</hi> Exhibited their
Bill in the Court of Wards againſt the ſaid Sir <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and
<hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> alledging, That the ſaid <hi>Martha</hi> was Daughter and

<hi>H.</hi> 8. were both of them above the Age of Conſent, and that they
Cohabited together Nine or Ten Years before the ſaid ſuppoſed Divorce;
during which Cohabitation the ſaid <hi>Martha</hi> was procreate between
them, and therefore pray they may have Licenſe to Traverſe the ſaid
Office. To which Bill the ſaid <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> put in
their anſwer, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> examined divers Witneſſes, and
before Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> dies; and thereupon the ſaid
<hi>Silveſter</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> exhibited a Bill of Reviver againſt
the ſaid <hi>Florence;</hi> and after, <hi>Martha</hi> having Iſſue
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Wife of the now <hi>Pl.</hi> died, after whoſe death
the ſaid <hi>Thomas Robertſon</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, bring a
new Bill of Reviver to revive the firſt Sute, in which the Witneſſes were
examined; and this Caſe was refer'd to <hi>Fleming</hi> and <hi>Coke,</hi>
Chief Juſtices, and <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> Chief Baron, and <hi>Selverton</hi>
and <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtices, and <hi>Sing</hi> and <hi>Altham</hi> Barons
of the Exchequer.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, for what reaſon was ſuch a Sentence given?
my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> nor the reſt will neither tie the Biſhop nor
themſelves to ſhew any; for he ſaith, The lawfulneſs of Marriage
belonging originally to be tried in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, if the
Eccleſiaſtical Judg (that is, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop) Sentence a Marriage Null, We
(that is, the Judges of the King's Courts) ought to give Faith (that is,
implicit Faith) to their Sentence, as they do to our Judgment, whether true or
falſe, right or wrong, reaſon or no reaſon; and ſo he ſaith, Where
the original cauſe of Sute concerning Marriage belongs to the Common Law
Courts, the Eccleſiaſtical Judg is to give like Faith to them; as 22.
<hi>E.</hi> 4. in <hi>Corbets</hi> Caſe, which was this, Sir <hi>Robert

in the life of the ſaid <hi>Matilda,</hi> and hath Iſſue by her
<hi>Robert,</hi> and dies; <hi>Lettice</hi> Preached openly, that ſhe was the
lawful Wife of <hi>Robert,</hi> and her Son a mulier, <hi>Roger</hi> the Son of
Sir <hi>Robert Corbet,</hi> ſues in the Spiritual Court to Reverſe theſe
Eſpouſals between <hi>Robert</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Lettice;</hi> for
which <hi>Lettice</hi> ſues a Prohibition. In which Caſe it was Reſolved,
(1.) That if <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Matilda</hi> had had Iſſue, and had
been unjuſtly Divorced, and after <hi>Robert</hi> had Married
<hi>Lettice,</hi> and had Iſſue and died, that as long as the unjuſt
Divorce had continued, the Iſſue of <hi>Matilda</hi> could have had no
remedy at Common Law, the ſame gives ſo great Faith to the Sentence of the
Biſhop. (2.) That here <hi>Roger</hi> might ſue at Common Law,
notwithſtanding the ſecond Marriage, in regard the ſame was void, being
made while the firſt Wife lived. On which may <pb n="178" facs="tcp:49347:101"/>be noted,
the injuſtice of the Biſhops, being above Appeal in Judgment in theſe
particulars, (1.) Here is a lawful Matirmony Conſummate by the Birth of a
Child, and two Perſons thereby indiſſolubly joined together, by the Act
and Law of God, put aſunder by the Biſhop and his Papal Law. Here is a
Diſpute from Generation to Generation concerning the Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Marriage,
and Succeſſion to an Inheritance: Againſt the Marriage is alledged, That
the ſame was declared void by a Sentence of Divorce, or rather of Nullity
given by the Biſhop. Againſt it is anſwered by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a
Deſcendent of the ſaid Marriage, and the right Heir to the Inheritance,
that the cauſe of the ſaid Sentence was falſe. And ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to
prove, that the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kenne</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth
Stowell</hi> were both above the Age of Conſent to Marriage, in <hi>Anno</hi>
37. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and were then lawfully Married and Cohabited together Nine
or Ten Years, and the ſaid <hi>Martha</hi> was lawfully Procreate between
them before the pretended Divorce was made. Was there ever Probation more
Rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant tender'd? was there ever better Reaſon alledged by a poor Lady to
defend her Inheritance? On this, <hi>Hoskins, Bacon, Dodridge,</hi> and other
Council Argued ſo long from <hi>Term</hi> to <hi>Term,</hi> as was enough to
ſpend a good Portion before it was got. But, alas, to no purpoſe; for had
this <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> been Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelf, theſe
Judges will give no Relief or Hearing againſt a Biſhops Sentence, unleſs
his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will pleaſe to Revoke it himſelf. And notwithſtanding all
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrary, it was accordingly reſolved by all the Juſtices
and Barons, That ſhe muſt go without her Inheritance, and her Mother
<hi>Martha</hi> remain a Baſtard, till the Biſhop who made her ſo,
ſhould again unmake her, which was in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to adjudg
there ſhould be no Appeal in any caſe of <hi>Marriage, Filiation,
Aliment,</hi> or <hi>Succeſſion</hi> from the Biſhops to the Kings
Courts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He reſts not there, but ſays, <hi>Iiſdem
licentiam ad alia vota convolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da concedimus.</hi> So that here not only
Licence may be had for Money to Marry, but for the ſame to leave the old, and
make a new choice as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they pleaſe. And my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> will
have the Common Law to give ſuch Faith, that they ought not to queſtion
theſe doings, true or falſe, right or wrong; which ſets all Women and Men
to Sale for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and gave the occaſion to <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> to
call all Eccleſiaſticks <hi>Panders General</hi> for their Profit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Common Law Judges give the Biſhop the ſame
Supremacy of Power in Matrimonial Cauſes, ſince the Proteſtant Religion
hath made Marriage no Sacrament, as they had in the time of higheſt Popery,
and made it a Sacrament, though <hi>Sublata cauſa tollitur effectus.</hi> The
ſame ceaſing to be a Sacrament, and becoming a mear Temporal Contract, the
old ſuperſtitious Faith of a Sacrament ought not to be given thoſe who
are no Judges of Temporal matters.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:49347:101"/>
                  <p n="4">4. It is worth a ſmile in this Caſe, were it not
ſo wicked, to ſee how hot the Common Lawyers were a while in the ſcuffle
for Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Marriage. But no ſooner had the Biſhops turn'd the
muzzles of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Canons againſt them, and diſcharged their
piece of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring in a ſtrange Language, inſtead of a Sentence, but our
Worthies of the Law fell flat on their faces, and yielded the Royal Fort of the
Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and all the Proteſtant Subjects Laws and Liberties, eya
<hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> it ſelf, to the Mercy of the Enemy, by ſo abominable
a Judgment, that no Appeal lay to the Kings Courts againſt the Sentence of a
Biſhop, touching <hi>Marriage, Filiation,</hi> or <hi>Succeſſion,</hi>
true or falſe, right or wrong, with cauſe or without cauſe, a Reſolve
deſerving to be mark'd with a Note of perpetual Infamy, and Razed out of all
Records. On which and other Reaſons, though in moſt parts of Chriſtendom
the Clergy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally compoſed one Eſtate of the Country, yet ſince the
Reformation they were excluded from being any part of the Eſtates, and of
<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> neither were they allowed any Vote in their Aſſembly:
and far leſs Reaſon have they in <hi>England</hi> (ſeeing they have equal
Privilege here with the Gentry, and all other Lay-free-holders in Election of
Knights of the Shire) to aſſume any other Power in the Legiſlative,
Temporal or Spiritual, either in Perſon or by any other Repreſentative. The
like Practice is likewiſe in <hi>Venice,</hi> though they are Catholicks,
where before the Council ſits, the Cryer with a loud Voice commands all
Prieſts out of Doors, leſt they ſhould diſcover the State ſecrets to
the Pope, and likewiſe aſſume the Supremacy of Judgment from the
Temporalty to the Spiritualty; to produce which effects they are a dangerous
ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to be mixt, in how ſmall a quantity ſoever, in any Supream
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and a little Leven of ſo active a Fermentation, Leveneth the whole
Lump. A Reaſon is given by <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> why it was held by more,
That the Pope was above a Council, than a Council above a Pope, becauſe Popes
gave Biſhopricks and Arch-Biſhopricks, but Councils gave none. Which doth
not only hold in meer Spiritual Councils, but in ſuch Spiritual Councils as
are mixt with the Temporalty, in which the Spiritualty are always Bribed and
Penſion'd by the gift of their Offices: And this is apparent, and needs no
further proof. And if any of the Temporalty receive the like Bribes and
Penſions, upon lawful proof thereof made, it cannot be denied, that neither
of them are equal or fit Legiſlators, and much leſs Judges of the Holy Laws
of God, of <hi>Marriage, Filiation,</hi> and <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of
Subjects, and leaſt of all of Kings.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They are prohibited by the example of Chriſt to
Judg</hi> Marriage, Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Aliment, <hi>or</hi> Succeſſion.</p>
                  <p>We Read, Chriſt was at a Marriage-Feaſt, but it was ſo
poor a one, they wanted Wine, and 'tis likely he would have helped them to
none, had the man been rich; for he might have bought enough for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
without Miracle. But Chriſt ſhewed his Bounty to the Poor, and the Rich he
ſent empty away. We read likewiſe, he taught the Doctrine of Marriage: but
it was according to the Moral Law of God, and all Ceremonial Laws he
Eſtabliſhed; neither did he or his Apoſtles ever join any hands by the
Ceremonies of a Prieſt or Temple, nor ever ſpake of any other joining Man
and Woman together; but by God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it was from the beginning. And as to
the point of being a Judg of <hi>Marriage, Filiation, Aliment,</hi> and
<hi>Succeſſion,</hi> he utterly refuſed it, though he knew the Fact and
the Right far above any Biſhop, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.14. <hi>And one
of the company ſaid unto him, Maſter, Speak to my Brother, that he divide
the Inheritance with me. And he ſaid unto him, Man, Who made me a Judg or a
Divider over you?</hi> To give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Caſe, according to
Epiſcopal Doctrine, Chriſt muſt firſt have enquired with what
Ceremonies the Father and Mother were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, whereby the Marriage muſt
have been firſt Judged. Then, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe two Brothers were begot before
the Ceremonies, or after, and whether there were Witneſſes at the
begetting, which concerns <hi>Filiation.</hi> Then, Whether the Inheritance,
which, according to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Law, then Imperial in
<hi>Judaea,</hi> included both Lands and moveable Goods, were left by a
Teſtate, or an Inteſtate; which would have concerned the <hi>Aliment</hi>
and <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> but Chriſt in a word refuſed to Judg any of
theſe. And thoſe who alledg themſelves his Succeſſors, ought to
follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who if he ſent them, ſent them to teach, and not to
Judg. For he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Go teach all Nations;</hi> but there is not a
word of Judging any Nation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They are totally ignorant in the Fact, and were
never Educated in the Laws by which they pretend to Judg Marriage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That 'tis impoſſible for them to know the Facts of
<hi>Marriage</hi> or <hi>Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> or to receive any Teſtimony of the
ſame, is already ſhewn and proved, <hi>P.</hi> 104, 105. and indeed the
Cook with his white Sleeves who dreſs'd the Wedding-Dinner, and the Tailor
who made the Wedding-Cloaths, and the Midwife and Goſſips who eat the Pie,
and drunk the Bowl, (if any Certificate or Judgment were at all neceſſary
as to the <pb n="181" facs="tcp:49347:102"/>Fact of <hi>Marriage</hi> and
<hi>Filiation,</hi> beſides that of the Parents) were far more credible and
fit, than the Biſhop's who was an Hundred Miles off at the time of getting
the Child, and of all theſe doings beſides.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Law, 'tis known they were never Educated either
in the Civil, Canon, Common or Statute Laws; the knowledg of all which they
themſelves cannot but acknowledg are neceſſary to make up an
Eccleſiaſtical Lawyer: by which is manifeſt, they are as ignorant of the
Law of <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Filiation,</hi> as they are before proved to
be of the Fact. With what Face or Conſcience can they undertake to be Judges
of what they are totally Ignorant, except only to take account of the Money and
Gaines?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>They Judg by a Chancellour and Commiſſaries,

                  </p>
                  <p>The Cauſes are, Firſt, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> whereof they
are before proved Guilty. The Second, <hi>Pride,</hi> that they may be equal to
Kings who pream Judg or Legiſlative Power can delegate Judgment. A Biſhop
muſt therefore be a Judg Supream, or Delegate; if he Arrogate to be Supream,
he ought not to be ſuffer'd; if a Delegate, <hi>Delegatus non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Delegare.</hi> The Third, is <hi>Sloth,</hi> to take the Gains and not the
Pains of doing Juſtice. The Fourth, is <hi>Covetouſnes,</hi> that they may
have Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Offices, and let them to Farm to Deputies; all which are
moſt ſad Ingredients to compound a Judg of <hi>Marriage, Filiation,</hi>
and <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> and it is clean contrary to the known Laws, for
any Judg Delegate to Act by Deputy, and not in Perſon; for the Office of a
Judg, is an Office of Truſt, and cannot be granted over; and neither ought
nor can be executed by any Aſſign, Deputy, Commiſſaries, or
Chancellour, but ought to be ſerved in Perſon; beſides, they

take advantage of the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, rather than ſuffer ſuch a
Contradiction, which in Law is called an Inconvenience. The Second Reaſon he
gives, is, becauſe the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the Biſhop is the higeſt kind of
Trial that is in the Law in this behalf.</p>
                  <p>But with due reſpect to ſo grave an Author, whoſe
failings are rather to be imputed to the time of Popery wherein he was born,
and writ, than to his Perſon. In anſwer to his Reaſons alledged, I ſay,
firſt, to the Maxim, That 'tis better to ſuffer a private miſchief, than
a publick Inconvenience, or, which is much like it, is better one man periſh
than the whole People, is to be intended only where the Caſe is reduced to
that neceſſity, that either one or other muſt be; but in this there is no
neceſſity Trial ſhould be by Certificate of a Biſhop at all; and though
<hi>uno abſurdo dato mille ſequuntur,</hi> were there a Thouſand
inconveniences followed, if the Certificate of a Biſhop ſhould be
queſtion'd for falſity, it being firſt granted, it belongs to him to make
Certificates; yet there is no neceſſity that abſurdity ſhould be
firſt granted, that it ſhould belong to him to make Certificates. for there
are ways enough (wherein no Inconveniences follow) of Trial of Truth, without
Certificates of Biſhops. (2.) The ſuppoſition is repugnant and
impoſſible, that any Caſe ſhould happen or be ſhewn in the World,
wherein Fiction or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ought to be ſuffer'd in Judicial proceeding; or
where Probation ought not by the Law of God to be admitted againſt ſuch
Fiction and Falſity, (notwithſtanding the corrupt practice of Courts to the
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) and ſuch ſuffering of a private miſchief of that kind to a
private Perſon, is ſo far from preventing a publick Inconvenience, that it
will bring both a private and publick miſchief, and deſtroy both; for it is
as impoſſible to ſeparate Truth from Juſtice, as the Light from the
Sun. (3.) That which is alledged for an inconvenience to the publick, That one
Biſhop would make a Certificate contrary to another, this is no more publick
inconvenience, than if Thieves ſhould fall out, and true men come by their
Goods. (4.) As to what is ſaid, That the Certificate of the Biſhop is in
this Caſe the higheſt Trial in the Law, we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Law;
for it was then the Law of Popery was Predominant, <pb n="189" facs="tcp:49347:106"/>which
gave Supremacy in Cauſes of <hi>Marriage, Filiation,</hi> and
<hi>Succeſſion,</hi> to the Biſhops above Kings, and to the Sentences in
Biſhops Courts, and made them above Appeal to the Kings Courts, and the
Foundation of that their Supremacy was, That then by that Law Marriage was a
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Penance was a Sacrament; but the Law being now changed from
Popiſh to Proteſtant, and the Supremacy being now given by the Proteſtant
Law to the King, above the Biſhop, as well in Cauſes Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, as in
all other Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, and the Proteſtant Religion, taking
away the two Popiſh Sacraments of <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Penance,</hi>
which were the only Roots whence the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction of Marriage,
and the incidents to the ſame pretended to ſprout, <hi>Ceſſante
Cauſa, &amp; ratione le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis ceſſat &amp; Lex,</hi> the pretended Cauſes
of the Juriſdiction ceaſing, the Juriſdiction it ſelf ceaſes, whereby
now the Certificate of the Biſhop is ſo far from being the higheſt Trial,
that it ought to be no Trial at all; for the Sacraments ceaſing, the
Juriſdiction ceaſeth; and the Juriſdiction ceaſing, the Power of Trial
ought likewiſe to ceaſe. (5.) For Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to adviſe his Client to
maintain a falſe Certificate of the Biſhops, knowing it to be falſe, is
as wicked, as for the Biſhop to make a falſe Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, knowing it to be
falſe; or which is impoſſible for him to know to be true, as all relating
to <hi>Filiation</hi> are, it being their own Rule, <hi>Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atio non poteſt
probari,</hi> except by the Parents; wherefore, <hi>ex Ore Suo,</hi> they
condemn themſelves of falſe Judgment, and are not therefore fit to be
Judges. </p>

                  <p n="1">(1.) Ceremonies and Circumſtances differ, That
Marriage and other Acts, are impoſſible to be done without Circumſtances,
but the ſame is poſſible to be done without Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Ceremonies are always Acts external, and made the
objects of the external Senſes of Witneſſes, and are of no Uſe in
Marriage (but the gains of the Prieſt) where Witneſſes are unlawful, as
in Carnal knowledg; or impoſſible, as in <hi>Filiation,</hi> as is already
proved, <hi>P.</hi> 104, 105. But Circumſtances of Marriage may be both
external, or internal and inviſible. External, as Youth, Age, Sexes, Health,
Sickneſs, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Unity. Internal and Inviſible, as Religion,
Conſcience, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Vice, Love, Hatred, and the like. Ceremonies make Acts
gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which they call decent, or deformed before men; but Circumſtances
only make them ſo before God.</p>

                  <p n="4">(4.) No Ceremonies in Marriage, are Commanded or
Prohibited in the Moral Law of God; but many Circumſtances are Commanded, and
many Prohibited in the ſame Moral Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) God is the Author of all Natural and Moral
Circumſtances, which make Marriage lawful or unlawful; but the Devil is the
Author of Ceremonies where is no Miracle or ſign of Miſſion from God. And
it hath been before ſhewn, the compulſion to Ceremonies of Marriage came

ſuch as judg Marriage by ſuch Ceremonies come not from God.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Ceremony, is a matter of Formality in Judgment, but
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, if any, is the matter of Subſtance. To conclude, it is a
thing ſo abſurd to judg by Ceremonies above Circumſtances, and by
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities above Subſtance, that never any Lawyer was ſo ſhameleſs to
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in writing, or lay any ſuch Principle in judicial Proce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Law of man can not make any Ceremony or other matter to be Subſtance,

of Carnal knowledg Conſummate privately between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no Woman could

<hi>P.</hi> 154, 155. (3.) That by the pronunciation of the words by the

                     <p>As to Community of Women, it is manifeſt, that the Canon
of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which nulls all Marriages except before a
Prieſt in a Temple, and the Certificates of Biſhops and Penance, gives a
general Licenſe for Money, either the <hi>Taxa Camerae</hi> of the Pope, or
the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation Money of the Biſhops, to have all Women common: for by
decreeing no Marriages ſhall be of Validity, except with a Woman brought
before a Prieſt and a Temple, they null and diſſolve all Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made
by the Moral Law of God, and the Obligations of them; whereby if any man lie
with an Hundred Women, and get them with Child, if he hath been ſo cunning as
not to lead any of them to a Prieſt in a Temple, there is no obligation on
him to own any of theſe for Wife or Child, in regard the Moral Law of God is
aboliſh'd by the Papal and Epiſcopal Canons, and made of no effect by their
Traditions and wicked Cuſtoms; and the Party is left free to lie with as many
more, and to have common amongſt them <hi>Sans nombre,</hi> if he will but
give them Money for their Hire, and the Biſhop Commutation Money; and what is
this but to have Women common to the Rich, and to exclude the Poor who have not
Money, from having any? But this would be prevented, if the Biſhops would, as
they ought to do, compel the man who gets a Virgin with-Child, to marry her
according to the Moral Law of God, and the expreſs Precept of Scripture,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 22.16. <hi>If a man entice a Maid who is not betrothed, he
ſhall ſurely endow her to be his Wife.</hi> Which enticement is as well
intended by Money, as Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Law the ſame, as well in caſe
of Force or Rape, as entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <pb n="202" facs="tcp:49347:113"/>but more Penal.
<hi>Deut.</hi> 22.28. <hi>If a man find a Damſel that is a Virgin which is
not betrothed, and lay hold on her and lie with her, and they be found, then
the man that lay with her ſhall give the Virgins Father Fifty Sheckels of
Silver, and ſhe ſhall be his Wife, becauſe he hath hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her, he may
not put her away all his days.</hi> This is the clear Moral Law of God, and the
clear Texts of Scripture, and there is by them laid an indiſſoluble
obligation on the man according to the old Form of Eſpouſal, <hi>Se poſt
Concubitum invitam non deſerturum;</hi> and if there is a Child born, by
reaſon of the further Obligation of Parents laid on them by the manifeſt
Act of God, it is not in the Power of theſe Virgins who are now become
Mothers, will they, nill they, nor of any human Power, to diſſolve that
which the Divine Power by giving birth to a Child hath once eſtabliſhed.
But Popes and Biſhops are ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling theſe deflowrers of
Virgins, to Marry then and theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getters of Children to acknowledg them
according to this moſt clear and juſt Law of God, and according to the
Obligations both <hi>Ex Contractu Reali,</hi> which are the lying with them and
getting them with-Child, and <hi>Ex Maleſicio Reali,</hi> which are the
ſame, that they like the Giants who would ſtorm Heaven, (Oh Helliſh
preſumption!) Level all the Canons they have, againſt the Divine Laws of
God himſelf, and with them tear in pieces all Obligations laid by them of
Husbands to Wives, and Fathers to Children, that Women may be in common, and
Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in common, <hi>Nullius Filii Populi Filii;</hi> confounding Heaven
and Earth, and all Divine and Human Rights, and ſubverting the courſe of
Nature as far as they are able, to obtain to themſelves the inexhauſtible
Treaſure and invincible Power over Princes and People, over Emperors and
Kings, incident to the Juriſdiction of <hi>Marriage, Filiation,</hi> and
<hi>Succeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how eaſily are theſe Giants quell'd, and all the
miſchiefs enſue, by their letting the World looſe to Community of Women,
and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Children. (1.) 'Tis but to give liberty to thoſe who
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to Marry according to the Moral Law of God, and to free them from
compulſion to the Ceremonial Law of a Prieſt in a Temple. (2.) 'Tis but to
give Power to the Temporal Judges and Magiſtrates to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſuch as have
had Children by Virgins, and deſert them, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg thoſe Virgins,
according to the clear Texts of Scripture, to be their Wives, and not to leave
them and their Children in common; which ought to be their incloſed
Propriety. </p>
                     <p>Whence would enſue, that if any man ſaw, that
whatſoever Virgin he did firſt touch, he ſhould be compell'd to take, he
would follow the Poets Counſel. <pb n="203" facs="tcp:49347:113"/>

                        </q> He would certainly chooſe,
unleſs corrupted by Money, one whom he liked above all others; and having
ſo fair a Garden incloſed of his own choice, he would be the more unlikely
to run to graze in a Common; or if be ſhould, he might find his expectation
much deceiv'd: for the ſame Juſtice having been done by the Magiſtrate on
all others as well as himſelf, he would find no Common to run in, but every
Quillet incloſed; nor ſhould a ſingle Woman be let, would ſhe take him
where another had Right, to claim him. As to Fornication, Adultery, Stews,
Brothels, how great a cauſe the compulſion of Publick Appearance in
Marriage before a Prieſt in a Temple by prohibition of Private Marriage, is,
the ſame is ſhewn already before, <hi>P.</hi> 107, and as to the
diſſeminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Fornication, Adultery, Stews and Brothels, not only of
that <hi>miſerabile ſcortorum flagellum,</hi> the <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi>
the inſeparable conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant of thoſe Vices and Places, but likewiſe of
all other Epidemical contagious and deadly Diſeaſes amongſt the People,
the ſame is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but Epiſcopal Courts get as much by the Dead as the
Living, and more by the Vicious than Vertuous. It is their Intereſt therefore
to continue it ſo long as they can.</p>
                     <p>It will be objected againſt the giving Power to Temporal
Magiſtrates, to compel every Man who hath a Child or Children by a Virgin, to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg her for his Wife, and her Children his, on Probation made of the
Fact, that 'tis impoſſible if Marriages are tolerated without a Prieſt in
a Temple, or a Juſtice of Peace in his Hall or Banns, at the Church or
Market-Croſs, to have Witneſſes or any other Teſtimony or Evidence of
the Fact, unleſs the Magiſtrate ſhould give Sentence, as the Biſhop
doth, without Probation.</p>
                     <p n="1">To which is anſwer'd, Firſt, That Toleration of
Private Marriage without Publick Witneſs of Prieſt or Magiſtrate, is no
denial of liberty to thoſe who deſire Publick Witneſs of their Contracts
of Marriage; no more than the Toleration of paſſing Lands by Livery and
Seiſin <hi>in Pays,</hi> is a denial to paſs them by Fines and Recoveries,
or other matter of Record, which is publick Teſtimony; but Parties may uſe
one or the other, or both, as they deſire and think ſuits beſt with their
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; but that which is here preſs'd, is, that no Mans Chriſtian
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty be infringed, nor he be compell'd to make publick Witneſſes either
of Prieſt or Magiſtrate, but be left free, where God hath not prohibited
him, to do as beſt ſuits with his own Conſcience and Convenience,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unjuſt Penalties laid on himſelf, his Wife or his Children, for
omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Ceremony never inſtituted by God, but full of great danger
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49347:114"/>and miſchief to many, though not to all, whoſe
Conſciences and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences are not alike, but of different States, as is
already before ſhewn, <hi>P.</hi> 108. eſpecially between Poor and Rich;
for the Poor need neither Writing nor Witneſſes for Portions or Jointures,
as perhaps the Rich think themſelves to need.</p>
                     <p n="2">Secondly, Parties that deſire Witneſſes, may, no
queſtion, have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Witneſſes at their own Home in Private, and with
leſs inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well for Contract of Marriage, as they have for all
other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Contracts; than a Prieſt in a Temple, or Juſtice of Peace in
his Hall, or Biſhop in his Cathedral, or ony other Publick Officer
whatſoever; and one of the <hi>Jews</hi> ways, which was never queſtion'd,
but lawful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient was, to Marry by written Inſtruments of Contract
without Prieſt or Temple.</p>
                     <p n="3">Thirdly, Though Parties that Marry have neither
Witneſs Publick or Private, yet they have Power, if they can Write, to give a
Note in Writing one to another; or if they cannot, to give ſuch ſecret
Tokens or Pledges, as without Witneſſes, will be ſufficient to evidence
their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Congreſſes when their happens any neceſſity, as
<hi>Judah</hi> when he went in to <hi>Tamar</hi> his Daughter in Law,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 38.18. He ſaid, <hi>What Pledg ſhall I give thee? and ſhe
ſaid, Thy Signet and thy Bracelers, and thy Staff that is in thy hand; and he
gave it her, and came in unto her, and ſhe Conceived by him;</hi> and after,
being accuſed of Whoredom, <hi>Verſe</hi> 25. <hi>When ſhe was brought
forth ſhe ſent to her Father in Law, ſaying, by the Man whoſe theſe
are, am I with-Child; and ſhe ſaid, diſcern, I pray thee, whoſe theſe
are, the Signet, and Bracelets, and Staff:</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi>
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged them.</p>
                     <p n="4">Fourthly, If the Law were made, as it ought to be,
That Private Marriage without Witneſs, and Procreation of a Child, between
two Perſons not prohibited by the Law of God to Marry, ſhould be a Civil
Act <hi>Sine poena aut infamia,</hi> and not a Criminal, as it is unjuſtly
made in the Biſhops Courts; if done without their Ceremonies of a Prieſt in
a Temple, the Proceeding of a Temporal Judg would be then Legal, and according
to the ordinary courſe of Juſtice, (if a Woman came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and firſt
took her Oath, that ſuch a man had her Virginity, and that the Child ſhe
hath is his Child) to put the man to his Oath concerning the ſame; for this
is then no Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> nor Self-accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of a Crime, when
the Fact is made no Crime, and is no other than like an Oath of diſcovery of
a Civil Contract in Chancery, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Law, of No Debt, or Non-Summons at
Common Law, and only gives the Woman and her Child the Civil Benefit to be in
as good a State and Condition, as if ſhe had been Married by the Ceremony of
a Prieſt in a Temple, and no farther; and this without Penalty to the Father,
who being put to his Oath, if he deny not what is alledged 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49347:114"/>againſt him, nothing is more juſt than that he
ſhould be compell'd (if he refuſe) to acknowledg the Woman to be his Wife,
and the Child his Child.</p>
                     <p n="5">Fifthly, when once it were known that the Magiſtrate
had a Legal Power to perform this, he would be rarely troubled concerning any
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Marriage; but every man concerned in the ſame will be careful ſo
much the more to perform the duty both of an Husband and Father in a Secret
than a Publick Marriage, by how much the more he deſires to keep it
ſecret.</p>

the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Kadaſh, Joſ.</hi> 2.1. is tranſlated in
<hi>Engliſh, Harlot,</hi> and <hi>Rahab</hi> is ſo called; and 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 14.24. the ſame is tranſlated <hi>Sodomite;</hi> yea at this
day the Devil, under the name of Holineſs, ſo much poſſeſſes the
<hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Prieſts of <hi>Pegu,</hi> that they keep in the Temples
Conſecrated Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, to make gains of them to the Prieſt, who are
eſteemed by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt Sacred. Oh to what height of wickedneſs doth
the Devil draw people, where he makes the Prieſt his Inſtrument to
counterfeit Holineſs with their Ceremonious Fopperies of Conſecration, and
bring the ſame into a Temple with the Name and Doctrine of being Sacred. The 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49347:115"/>ſame was done amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> a wiſe
Nation, and by a wiſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator of theirs, even <hi>Solon</hi> himſelf;
yet did the Devil and Prieſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude him under the name of Holineſs; for he
cauſed by his Laws, as a Fundamental of Government, to begin his <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Holy Church, and to that end he
appoints a Temple to be Dedicated to <hi>Venus,</hi> and Prieſts to be
Conſecrated, and Sacrifices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; and to be well govern'd by the
Prieſts, he ſtocked the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a multitude of Conſecrated Whores,
to be let to hire to increaſe the Prieſts Profit and Pleaſure; and this
Holy Church he endowed with great Revenues and Privileges. There were the like
Holy Churches fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the like Holy Siſters at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at
<hi>Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Abydos,</hi> and ſo great veneration they were in
amongſt the People, no doubt, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pious Sermons of the Prieſts,
what Miracles theſe Female Angels could do, that they attributed the whole
overthrow of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> with his almoſt innumerable Army, to the Holy
Prayers of theſe Conſecrated Whores, in their Temples or Stews, to their
Goddeſs <hi>Venus.</hi> Here Whoredom for the gains of the Prieſts and
Temples is Conſecrated, and believed not only by the groſſer ſort of
People, but by the chief Princes and Governour, to be a Thing moſt
Sacred.</p>
                     <p>And is not Adultery with us, more wickedly than Fornication
amongſt the Heathen, Conſecrated by compulſion to the Ceremony of a
Prieſt in a Temple? It is; for if <hi>A.</hi> get <hi>B.</hi> with-Child, and

deſerts her, and <hi>A.</hi> gets the good will of <hi>D,</hi> and <hi>C</hi>
gets the good will of <hi>B,</hi> and the two Women being both with-Child, and
both deſerted, grow more politick to prevent after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and tell
their new Courtiers peremptorily, that they ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no farther favour
from them until they lead them before a Prieſt in a Temple, and Marry them
there; now the only lawful way had been for theſe two Women to relieve
themſelves againſt their unjuſt Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that a Magiſtrate had a
Legal Power on complaint of the Women injured, to compel each Deſertor to
acknowledg his proper Wife and Child; but they take here a courſe to leap out
of the Pan into the Fire, and to cure or cover a leſſer Evil, by committing
a greater, and go to Church to commit Croſs-Adultery, and Croſs-Marry, one
the Man who had got the other with-Child, and the other the Man who had got the
firſt with-Child; and the Prieſt accordingly joins them, and contracts and
pronounces each Couple Man and Wife, and gives his Benediction; is not here
Adultery Conſecrated under the name of Marriage, and falſe Wives given to
falſe Husbands, and falſe Children to falſe Fathers? and this
Conſecration of Adultery makes it ſo indiſſoluble, that no Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall be admitted to the contrary, either for Husband or Wife, or Father or
Child. Certainly this is far worſe than any Conſecration of Fornication
amongſt the <hi>Pagan</hi> Prieſts of <hi>Priapus</hi> or <hi>Venus.</hi>

                     <p>The World in its Primitive Innocence kept all Wives
ſecured under the Cuſtody of their Husbands, and all Daughters under the
Cuſtody of their Parents; the ſtrictneſs of which appears to this day in
many <hi>Southern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, till the Prieſts of
<hi>Priapus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> for they were the moſt ancient of which
any Hiſtories ſpeak; and as <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Agrippa</hi> mentions, none were
to be admitted Prieſts who were not firſt initiated in the Myſteries of
<hi>Priapus.</hi> Theſe therefore could not pretend to be Prieſts, unleſs
they had a God or Goddeſs to whom they might pretend to Sacrifice and Serve,
and become mediators to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Prayers of the People; a God they could
not have, unleſs they made an Idol; and an Idol they could not have, without
a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſecure it, and their rich Offerings, againſt the Spoil either
of Thieves or Weather: So the Building of Temples was the firſt means of
ſetting up Idols, and the ſetting up Idols the firſt means of
Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration and Adoration of them, for Gods and Goddeſſes; and to draw
a Conflux of Worſhippers, there was no better way of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Men,
than by the Women; and of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than by the Men, and of both them, by
Feaſting with Sacrifice, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:49347:116"/>Muſick, Dancing, Dalliance
and Whoredom; whence ſo frequently Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in Scripture is called <hi>going
a Whoreing after Idols:</hi> for indeed the Prieſts became thereby the
Pandars-General, as <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> calls them, by drawing Women to
their Temples both for Marriages and Whoredoms, and firſt made them offer
their Virginities for Sacrifices to their Idols and Prieſts, before this
Spiritual Court of theirs would give them Licenſes to Marry; for which, as
now, they compell'd them to pay their Fees; and to colour this Uncleaneſs the
better, they Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated thoſe impure Gods and Goddeſſes, <hi>Priapus,
Baal-Peor, Milcom, Adonis,</hi> (whoſe Worſhippers were the ſame the

muſt Worſhip him in Spirit, and Truth</hi> 'Tis granted, the <hi>Jews</hi>

privately in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, appears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5. <hi>When thou
prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be as the Hypocrites are: for they love to pray
ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the Corners of the Streets, that they may
be ſeen of Men. Verily I ſay unto you, they have their reward. But when
thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door,

were their Churches or Temples, having a leſſer or Parochial

that in both the leſſer and the greater Chriſt uſed to Teach, as it is
ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.23. <hi>And Jeſus went about all</hi> Galilee,
<hi>teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom,
and healing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſickneſs, and all manner of Diſeaſes
amongſt the People.</hi> And <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.49. he ſaith of himſelf,
<hi>I was daily teaching in the Temple.</hi> And the avoiding of publick Prayer
he taught not only by his Precept but Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for we never find that he ſo
much as Convened the Twelve, who were his own Family, to pray with him, but
<hi>Mark</hi> 1.35. <hi>He went out, and departed into a ſolitary place, and
there prayed.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He went up into a Mountain
apart to pray: and when the Evening was come, he was there alone.</hi> And
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.36. <hi>Then cometh Jeſus with them unto a place
called</hi> Gethſemane, <hi>and ſaith unto the Diſciples; Sit ye here,
while I go and pray yonder.</hi> Whereby it is clear, that Chriſt both by
Precept and Example taught, there ought a diſtinction to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
place of Preaching and Prayer; the one to be publick, the other to be private,
the one to be in conventions, the other to be ſingle and alone; and if he
prohibited the contrary to any who were free, he much more prohibited any
ſhould be compell'd.</p>
                     <p>Then as to <hi>Non-Communicants,</hi> 'tis manifeſt
Chriſt never inſtituted the Sacrament in a Church, or Temple, nor appointed
the ſame to be after Celebrated there; for he inſtituted it in a private
Houſe, and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him, but his own private Family with him, as
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.17. It is ſaid, <hi>Now the firſt day of the Feaſt of
unlevened bread, the Diſciples came to Jeſus, ſaying unto him, where wilt
thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Paſſeover? And he ſaid, Go into
the City to ſuch a man, and ſay unto him, The Maſter ſaith, My time is
at hand, I will keep the Paſſeover at thy Houſe with my Diſciples.</hi>
The reaſons why Chriſt prohibited publick and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded private Prayers,
may be divers. (1.) The firſt is expreſs'd to avoid vain glory, and
ſuſpition of Hypocriſie. (2.) To avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers incident to
Conventions in Temples, or publick Places, whereby he foreſaw his Church
might be deſtroyed; and how many of the Primitive <pb n="212" facs="tcp:49347:118"/>Chriſtians, and ſince, have by this means of the Conventions in
Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Temples, ſuffer'd; ſome have had the Churches fired about
them and themſelves burnt in them, others have been in them Maſſacred
with the Sword, others carried away and deſtroyed by Torments, which had
never happened to them, if they had followed Chriſts Precept, of not
caſting their Pearl before Swine; or when they were perſecuted in one City,
to flie to another, or kept themſelves in their Cloſets to pray. (3.) The
impoſſibility of a Convention of People to agree what they would have
prayed for, were it but when they would have Rain and Dry-weather. (4) The
impoſſibility of worſhipping God in Spirit and Truth, unleſs he is
worſhip'd as Omnipreſent; for as he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God in an Image, or
towards an Image, commits Idolatry, becauſe he confines his Omnipreſence to
the petty Priſon of an Idol: ſo, who in his Imagination comprehends him who
is Incomprehenſible, in the walls of a Temple, is as guilty of Idolatry as
the other, only one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips him in a greater Idol, and the other in a
leſſer. And as to Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in a Temple, or by a Prieſt, 'tis manifeſt
the <hi>Jews</hi> never Married in a Temple, nor did Chriſt ever Marry any
Man or Woman, nor any of the Apoſtles Marry any, nor had any Precept to do
it; and all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians for 300 Years after Chriſt, ſo far
obſerved the Precept and Example of Chriſt, and abhor'd Marriage, or
Worſhip in Temples and Altars; that <hi>Celſus</hi> doth reproach them with
it, that they had no Sacred places of publick Worſhip; and <hi>Origen</hi> in
Anſwer, confeſſeth that they were not inſtituted by Chriſt, but crept
in afterwards.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all which, the Divinity of the later Times
hath been ſo far from following the Precept and Example of Chriſt, that it
hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Omnipreſential Worſhip of God, commanded by him in
Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Truth, with a gawdy Ceremonial Worſhip by Prieſts and Temples;
for to diſcover the Truth of this great Myſtery of Iniquity, of Popiſh
Prieſts, it concerns them in the higheſt points of their Profit, to
aboliſh as much as they can poſſible, all thoughts of Gods
Omnipreſence, for if this is once underſtood, it will appear there is no
need for the People to pray by a Prieſt, whereby they will loſe their
gainful Offices of Maſters of Requeſts; for where the Prince is in
preſence, there needs no ſuch Officer. (2.) This will loſe their gainful
Office of Confeſſion of Sins, for where God is in Preſence, 'tis better
to confeſs to him than the Prieſt. (3.) It will loſe them their
Pardon-Office, which brings them in Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for who is ſo mad to beg
Pardon of a Prieſt, if God is in preſence, and he may beg it of him? (4.)
It will loſe him his great Office of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of all thoſe who are
Married in his Temple; for if God is in preſence at
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ome, of whom the Party may
crave a Benediction, who is ſo mad to think he need go beg a Benediction of a
Prieſt in a Temple? (5.) It will loſe him his Office of Excommunication,
and caſting out of <pb n="213" facs="tcp:49347:118"/>his Synagogue and out of the
Preſence of God: for if God is Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then can none caſt out of
his preſence: for theſe good Reaſons are all the Clamorous School men
ſilent, and have writ nothing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial concerning that great Attribute of
God his Omnipreſence: nor have the in numerable Heaps of Theologiſts
incloſed any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of this point: nor have the Biſhops ſo
much as once named it in the 39. Articles; but, like Lapwings, drawing the
Readers as far as they can from their neſt, diverting his Fancy when they
ſpeak of God, to matters unintelligible, and not neceſſary to Salvation,
and fitting the reſt with matters totally Tending to their gain.</p>
                     <p>I cannot paſs the Contemplation of the Omnipreſence of
God, without ſome further Remarques; for without this he could not be
Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, he could not be Omniſcient, he could not be a God, he could not
be diſtinguiſhed or known from an Angel or Daemon, or any inferior Spirit,
or Inviſible Power: But that theſe are Circumſcribed in their Vagrant
Ubi's, or Chain'd to their fix'd Localities, to dwell in ſuch a Temple, to
haunt ſuch a Grove, to give their Reſponſe from the hollow of ſuch a
Dodonaean Oak, Such a Delphick Den, from the belly of ſuch a Sibyll, the
Breaſt of ſuch a Prophet, the Brayns of ſuch a Dreamer of Dreams; Theſe
ſhew their Miracles only at ſuch an Image, ſuch an Idol, ſuch a Tomb,
ſuch a Sepulchre, ſuch a Fountain, ſuch a River, ſuch a Pool of

Fundamental of all Religion, and we cannot believe in Him unleſs we know Him,
and ſo cannot know Him unleſs we can diſtinguiſh Him from an Angel or
Daemon or other Inviſible Power, nor Worſhip in Spirit and Truth, unleſs
we can diſtinguiſh Theolatry from Angelolatry and Daemonolatry, and
Theology from Magick; nor when we are in diſtreſs can we know where to Pray
to Him for deliverance, if we know not where to find him; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inviſible is impoſſible to be found unleſs he is Omnipreſent; and if
we Run to Temples, Tombs, Images, Idols, Oracles, we fall into the Power of
Darkneſs, Daemons, Magicians or Deceivers; And even the foremention'd
<hi>Demonax</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> and many other Heathen, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will

is grown Anthorpomorphite, to deſcribe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power in human ſhape,

pierced him to the very Reins of his back, and caſt him all over into a
Terrible ſhivering; and ſurely if it were poſſible for a Soul to paſs

ſhine through the World, they could not pretend and deceive with Magick in
the name of Theology, with Necromancy under the name of Prayer at the Tombs of
Saints, and to their bones and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; they could not deceive with
Witchcraft and Malice under the Name of Converſe with God and Good Angels;
nor could they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Inſpirators without Miracle, if God is
Omnipreſent in every Soul alike. Divers Popes have been by Hiſtories N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

who have been great Magicians; and the Acting or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting many Miracles
by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Saints, both beneficial and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficial, are common in
their Legends: and the Turks have as many as they; And ſeldom a Tyrant goes
to Sea, but he will (if he can) have a Witch; ſo will they in their
Land-Enterprizes have their prophets, which are the ſame. The <hi>Tartar,
Chineſe,</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Prieſts are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Magicians, and
are Conſulted in all their Wars; ſo were the <hi>Magi</hi> of the
<hi>Perſians,</hi> and <hi>Brachmans</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> The
<hi>Druids</hi> of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Brittons,</hi> and many other

aſhamed to worſhip Devils, whom they called gods, and it was the
Profeſſed Divinity of <hi>Polytheiſt</hi> to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Conſult
Inferior Spirits, as well as the Supreme; yet amongſt Chriſtians, the
Profeſſion being only to Worſhip the Supreme, if they Publiſh the
Supreme to be Omnipreſent, they cannot pretend theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical ſpirits to
be God, or Good Angels, who confine themſelves only to ſome Perſons or
Places, and do Malefices either to Nations or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons; ſeeing if
they Pray to God Omnipreſentially, they may <pb n="216" facs="tcp:49347:120"/>be ſure
to be heard for all Lawful and neceſſary Prayers, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and
Maleficious never to be granted by him; whereby the Prieſt will looſe all
his Cuſtomers; for he that believeth God Omnipreſent will Pray alone, and
not Imploy another to Pray for him, to avoid the foremention'd Dangers: Firſt
becauſe, for ought he knows, the Prieſt who Prays for him may be a
Magician. Secondly, He will not Pray to a Saint or Angel, nor bring offerings
as the Prieſt would have him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, for ought he knows, this Saint or
Angel may be a Daemon Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angel of Light, whereby he

by a Prieſt, or to an Angel or Saint, by whom he pretends to have Power to
obtain unlawful Prayers, and to do Malefice; but likewiſe to obtain Lawful
Prayers and to Receive Benefits; becauſe the Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Payer both by God
or an Angel, or any Inviſible Power, is a Miracle, and the Prieſt takes
Money for every Miracle or benefit ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds by his Prayers of benefit to the
Party for whom he Prays; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it will be manifeſt, that the ſucceſs
of this Prayer is neither grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, nor a Good Angel; for God never
ſells his Mercies for Money. And this was the Theology of <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> a Magician, to think the Holy Ghoſt might be bought with Money; to
which was made a Tart Anſwer, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Peter ſaid unto him,

had been to have deprived God of thanks for his own Gift. And <hi>Petrus

they paid a Tribute or Impoſt for the ſame, The Manna ſuddenly ceaſed,

the Truth of God, receive neceſſary maintenance, for their ſtudy and
pains in Executing the ſame (unleſs they pretend to Preach by
Inſpiration) That their Doctrine is from Daemons, and not from God; for the
Labourer is worthy of his Hire, and theſe have not Received their Gift
freely, but by long ſtudy and Paynes: but only this is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, That if
they pretend to any Extraordinary and Miraculous Gift from God, or Angels, as
to be Mediators for Prayers, or to keep God under Lock and Key in a Temple, and
Receive money for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting the ſame, it is a Manifeſt ſign, they have
neither their Gift from God, nor Good Angels, but from Daemons. Some that have
Writ of Witchcraft, ſay, That ſuch as Pray, though to God, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
things, if they ſucceed and have Their Prayers granted, It is a Sign That
they have made a Covenant with the Devil; for God never grants unlawful
Prayers; therefore it muſt be the Devil, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And that a Man may be a
Witch, yet not know it. There being therefore two great Dangers to Pray by a
Prieſt who takes money for his Prayers; firſt, That he Prays to Daemons
under the Name of God. Secondly, That he will make unlawful Prayers. <hi>Quid
non mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia pectora cogit Auri ſacra fames? Flectere ſi nequeat

ſpread, men would rather Pray to God as <hi>Chriſt</hi> Commands, in
ſecret, and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentially, to whom they may Pray and He Exacts no money
of them, nor Compels their Conſciences to Pray in unlawful Forms, or for
unlawful Matters, rather than Imploy ſo Chargeable and Dangerous a Mediator,
who if God is in Perſon Omnipreſent, is not only uſeleſs, but hurtful;
whereby he will loſe all his Money and Hire for his Prayers, and the
Silver-Smiths of <hi>Diana,</hi> have their Trade utterly ſpoiled.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) Men would be induced to worſhip in ſecret, and
Omnipreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, to avoid another Danger incident to Prayer by a Prieſt;
for the Prayer by a Prieſt would be in Publick, in a Synagogue or Temple,
which is lyable to a double danger, one of Daemons, the other of Men; to
neither of which any Modeſt or Prudent Petitioner deſires to have his
Prayers known; not to Daemons, becauſe he may have Errors and Imperfections
in his Prayers, which if diſcovered only to God, He is ready to prevent
thoſe Dangers he would draw on his own head, by his Raſh Petitions, and,
like a Father in pity to his Child, to forgive them; whereas if Diſcovered to
Daemons, they, if not by God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, would be ready to grant him
ſucceſs in all the Noxious things he asks, to Inſnare and Ruin him. Not
to Men; firſt, becauſe for any to confeſs his private Sins, or Enumerate
his private Wants, or Deſires in Publick, would but afford matter of
Deriſion to the Heathens. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The malice of Men would be apt to

for unto thoſe days the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>did burn Incenſe to

the Idolatrous Prieſts, who made great gains of theſe Ceremonies of Bowing,
Kneeling, and Falling down to thoſe Images, that they were very Ancient and
Decent Ceremonies, and great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Worſhip of God; and they did

ſuch ſhuffling away of Hats, and falling on knees, to receive an
Abſolution, which none but God can give, of their Sins; and as aſſoon as
the Morning Service is ended, and the Prieſt got out of the Church all the
Hats are again on, and not a man to be ſeen on his knees till the Prieſt
again return in the Afternoon; then are they all again on their knees to pray,
according to the foremention'd diſtinction, towards him, but not (as they

God; and theſe Ceremonies of falling on their knees towards the Prieſt, in
thoſe many Poſtures of Confeſſions of Sins, Penance, Abſolution, and
Benedictions were ſo ſcandalous to the Heathen, that when a Chriſtian
reproved one of them that he fell down before a dead Idol and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it,
he would anſwer, That the Chriſtian fell on his knees before a worſe
living Idol, <hi>Et quod Pontificis coleret Genitalia.</hi> In the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was a Jeſuit Recriminated, who reproved an <hi>Indian</hi> King of
<hi>Cande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> that he fell down and worſhipped his Paw-God, and
anſwer'd, That He fell down and worſhipped his Crucifix. To the ſame
purpoſe have ſome Epiſcopal Proteſtants been Recriminated, who reproved
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts that they bowed and fell on their knees to the Hoſt in the Maſs,
and anſwer'd, that they bowed and fell on their knees to the High Altar and
the Bread received from it. So neither ſide can juſtifie, but Recriminate,
which how weak Argumentation it is concerning the worſhip of God in Spirit
and Truth, is eaſily underſtood. But to return to the firſt
conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; That the Prieſt is worſhipped, and not God, by the
Ceremonies of the Temple, appears, in regard if they taught that the People
muſt put off their Hats or fall on their knees in token of Reverence to God,
as being in the Temple Conſecrated by the Biſhop more than in another
place, then muſt they teach them that they ought to perform the ſame
Ceremonies when both Biſhop and Prieſt are out, as well as in; and muſt
be perpetually, as long as they are in the Church, ſeeing God is perpetually
in it, and both Biſhop and Prieſt muſt be perpetually unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered when
there, as well as the People, and as well before Service as after, and as well
without the People as with them; but they neither teach nor practice any ſuch
matter, but only command uncovering, and kneeling to be towards themſelves
when preſent, therefore they give the whole Honour of theſe External
Ceremonies to themſelves, and not to God. So the Popes Miſſionary
Prieſts breed up the poor <hi>Americans,</hi> in ſuch Superſtition and
Slavery, as they worſhip the Prieſts for Gods; and if a Prieſt do but
ride on a Journey through the ſtreet, they all as he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth fall on
their knees, with their hands Elevated towards him, praying him to forgive
their Sins, and give them their Benediction; which the Prieſt very gravely
doth, making many Mumpſimuſſes with his Mouth, <pb n="221" facs="tcp:49347:122"/>and
Croſſes in the Air with his finger towards them, and they for the ſame
bring him plenty of Proviſion and Oblations to his Lodging, where he Inns,
The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Moſcho,</hi> reputed the <hi>Greek</hi> Pope or
chief Patriarch, when he Conſecrates the River there for Baptiſm, which is
once a Year, he Rides in great State, in moſt Rich and Gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Robes,
carrying the Sacrament in his Lap, the Emperour himſelf leading his Horſe
by the Bridle, and many perſons caſting before him on the ground moſt
Rich Garments, to be trampled on by the proad Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, and when he hath
paſſed over a parcel ſtill fetching thoſe who are left behind, and
throwing them again before, leſt the feet of his Holy Horſe ſhould touch
the Earth, whoſe Maſter commands the Heaven. Some have thought by theſe
Ceremonies the Horſe is more honour'd than the Emperour, the Lap than the
Horſe, the Sacrament than God, and the Biſhop than all. The <hi>Latine</hi>
Pope hath had a Crotchet to wear the Croſs on his Pantofle when he admits to
the Honour of kiſſing his Toe, yet none doubts but he aims more at the
Honour of his Toe, though a crabbed one, than of the Croſs. To the Emperour

Homage, ſaying in Extenuation of his Diſhonour, <hi>Non tibi ſed
Petro,</hi> the Pope replied, <hi>Et mihi &amp; Petro.</hi> Not only the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> Prieſts of <hi>Bell,</hi> but of all Nations in the World
(who could obtrude on the People the Ceremonies of Sacrifie) have under
pretence of feeding the Noſes or the Mouths of their Gods, fed their own
Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and not their Gods. But the Doctrine of the Omnipreſence
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all theſe Ceremonies of Sacrifices, Incenſe, Burnt-offerings,
Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Hoſtes, Maſſes, High-Altars, Temples, and Oblations by
Prieſts; for if God is preſent in the Houſe, and at the Table of the
owner, were it poſſible he could be hungry, or deſire Meat and Drink, he
could, as many great Princes have done from their meaneſt ſubject, more
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently take a Meal from a Thouſand Tables whereſoever he likes
beſt, than the Prieſt to gather it for him in his Alms-basket at the
Temple; and there to eat it himſelf; and ſay to the Prieſt as is ſaid,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.12. <hi>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the
World is mine, and the fulneſs thereof. Will I eat the fleſh of Bulls, or
drink the blood of Goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy Vows unto
the moſt High. And call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> Were God likewiſe tolerated to be
worſhipped as Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Omnipreſentially,</hi> in Spirit and
Truth,<note place="margin">Forms of Prayer Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, are Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but
not Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</note> then could there be no compulſion to the Ceremonies of
Forms of Prayer, Forms of Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Forms of Songs, Forms of Muſick; for
Forms of Prayer and other Forms of Worſhip in things indifferent, if made
compulſive by Penalty, became Ceremonies, and deſtructive to the Worſhip
of God in Spirit and Truth; and compulſive they cannot be made unleſs the
Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the place of Worſhip be made compulſive. But if they are only 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49347:123"/>Directive and without Penalties, as the Form of the Lords
Prayer, left by Chriſt, who made it not Penal to miſs a word, or
ſyllable, or a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Uſe of the ſame, then are they no
Ceremonies, nor Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Laws, but Favours and Adminicles to help and
direct, and not to puniſh the Weak who need them; if Popes and Biſhops
therefore ſhould not ſmother the knowledg of Gods Omnipreſence, then
muſt they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that God is preſent in the heart of every one who Prays,
as well as in every other place, and being there, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith,
42.2. <hi>I know thou canſt do every thing, and that no thought can be
withholden from thee.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.9. <hi>The
Righteous God trieth the Hearts and Reins.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.11.
<hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man.</hi> And if ſo, they need neither
carry nor ſend their Prayers to a Pope, Biſhop, or Prieſt to offer them
to God, in a Temple or at the Altar; but he may preſent them to God
himſelf, and in a way more pleaſing to him, on his own Altar of a broken
heart, which way of Worſhip in the heart would utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their great
Office they uſurp, of being Maſters of the External Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of Divine
Worſhip, which brings them in infinite Riches, and likewiſe an Idolatrous
Worſhip and Honour to Exalt themſelves above all that is called God.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6.) If Prayers might be made to God in the heart of
man, or as Chriſt directs in the Cloſet, as Omnipreſent, then would the
Prieſt loſe his great gains of the Poſt-Office to Heaven, for ſending
Prayers though not by Letter or Writing, yet (which is as good) by word of
Mouth, or better, if the Letters ſhould chance to be loſt, or Spies for
Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence break them open by the way. When Prayers are brought to the
Prieſt, to be ſent ſo high and ſo far for the Petitioner, he will
ſend them by ſome Angel, who is the ſwifter, or ſome Saint who is the
ſlower and ſurer to carry them the firſt Stage, then He delivers the
Meſſage to our Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> (if ſhe be not below at her
Chappel) to carry them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stage, and to deliver them to her Son, who is
to make the next deliverance of them to God, which way of Poſting Prayers
ſo far is very coſtly, and dangerous, and many times Petitioners get no
Returns as long as they live, unleſs when intercepted by the Prince of the
Air, and he grants their wicked Petitions with a Vengeance; all which coſt
and miſchief had been prevented, if the Petitioner in perſon had, as
Chriſt bids him, offer'd his Prayer to God in perſon in his Cloſet.</p>
                     <p n="7">(7.) The Prieſts could not put God into a Wafer or
piece of Bread, and ſet him on an Altar, or carry him about in a Box; they
could not lock him up in a Temple, and carry the Keys at their: Gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dle; by which they would loſe
exceſſive gains.</p>
                     <p n="8">(8.) There would be no more Pilgrimages to
<hi>Mecha,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem, Rome, Loretto, Compoſtella,</hi> and a
multitude of other Places, which would loſe them vaſt gains.</p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:49347:123"/>
                     <p n="9">(9.) They would loſe the gains of Praying to Saints
and Angels; for they who believe God only to be Omnipreſent, and the
<hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi</hi>'s of Saints and Angels to be unknown, and uncertain when, and
whether in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or no; would rather pray to God only, than ſuch as they
knew not where or when to find, and might therefore be mocked, as
<hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.27. <hi>mocked</hi> Baals <hi>Prophets,
and ſaid, Cry aloud, for he is a God, either he is talking, or he is
purſuing, or he is in a Journey, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he ſleepeth, and muſt
be awaked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">(10.) They would loſe the gains of all Sanctuaries,
Aſylums, and Horns of the Altar; for if God is every where, why ſhould
Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have more privilege there than every where? whereby neither
<hi>Cain</hi> by Land, nor <hi>Jonah</hi> by Sea, could flie the Preſence of
the Lord, and the ſame is no Protection, but a Puniſhment to the
Wicked.</p>
                     <p n="11">(11.) There would be no more buying or hireing places
of Burial in Chancels, Churches, Church-yards, or other Conſecrated ground,
by ſuch as believed God Omnipreſent; whereby a great Revenue would
likewiſe be loſt to Popiſh Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
                     <p>All which recited matters, and the foremention'd Mediator,
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, Penance, and Pardon, Offices, and divers others, conduce
infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely to the gain of Papal and Epiſcopal Prieſts, and the Pride and
Power of the Kingdom of Anti-Chriſt; which muſt be inevitably ruin'd, if
the Doctrine of the Omnipreſence were but duly Preached and Taught, which
indeed is the Depth of all Philoſophy, and the Height of all Divinity, and
the moſt poſſible way of underſtanding the Divine Precepts of Chriſt,
of worſhipping God in Spirit and Truth.</p>

her Intention to Marry, to the Prieſt in the Temple, and the Boys in the

for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication according to the Canons. This is eaſily Anſwered, by
asking who made him a Legiſlator, and Canon-Maker, over a Free People and
their Children? This already is before proved, That neither Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
nor Temporal Law can be made, nor Tax impoſed on Marriage, or any thing
elſe, without the Aſſent of the Houſe of Commons, and that was never
given to any Papal or Epiſcopal Laws or Canons; as hath been already proved.

can be no Offence Beſides, if there were ſuch a Law, it is already before
ſhewn that all Laws Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting Marriage (Except by a Prieſt in a Temple)
are the Doctrine of Daemons, and came Originally from Daemons and the Prieſts
of <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and Contrary to the Moral Law of God
and Nature; the Biſhop hath therefore no pretence to Puniſh the Woman for
that.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) There are no other Offences in Bearing a Child
which a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can commit, but breach of Contract, Inceſt, Fornication or
Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. As to breach of Contract and Inceſt, the Biſhop puniſheth
Perſons Free, and not Prohibited by any Law of God to Marry: As to
Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Adultery, the firſt Offence cannot (as hath already been
ſhewn) be Committed without Polyandry in the Woman, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond without
Polygynecy in the Man; But the Biſhop puniſheth her who bears a Child,
though the Father and Mother were no way Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to Marry by any Law of God
or Man, and they were at the time of Begetting the Child both Virgins, and
neither Guilty of Polyandry <pb n="236" facs="tcp:49347:131"/>or Polygynecy, and ſo
ſtill continue Chaſt and Conſtant one to another: The Biſhop therefore
puniſhing ſuch a Woman, doth puniſh her for Child-Bearing, or for
nothing.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) There is no Probation, by two or more
Witneſſes, of any Offence but Child bearing; and Probation by Compulſion
of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſelf-Accuſation, or by Compulſion of Canonical Purgation
are unlawful. The Biſhop therefore puniſhing ſuch a Woman, if he puniſh
her not for Child-bearing only, he puniſheth her for Facts whereof he hath no
Lawful Probation.</p>
                     <p>It being therefore proved, That the Biſhop puniſheth
Lawful Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing: It appears further, That he puniſheth the Lawful more

Married to Husbands (and therefore can only be Guilty of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery) if the

Sanctuary for Adultereſſes, and for Adulterous Child-bearing they are
Exempt from puniſhment, but the Poor Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Child-bearing Woman, againſt
whom there is neither Fact nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of any Crime to be ſhewen, is the
Chief Subject of the Biſhops puniſhment: a Fact ſo Barbarous, as not to

become an Inſtrument by divulging his Viſions, and the Revelations in them,
to confirm their Superſtition amongſt the People, but it ſeems they were

ſhould detect their Knavery, attempted three times to poiſon him in the

again, hardly eſcaping with life, which made the <hi>Bernoyes</hi> begin not

his Enemies, poiſon'd the Bread, which the Prince having received, he
ſuddenly fell ſick, and his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſo violent, as he died the

Circumventing him by Perjury, and breach of Faith and Covenant, the moſt
Sacred Obligations of all humane Society, is very well, and more at large

in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped by a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note>The <hi>French</hi> King after Ten Years Civil
War, was adviſed to ſet on foot a Treaty of Peace, not ſo much out of any
deſign to quiet matters, as to enſnare the Proteſtants in ſome fatal
Trap, in which they might be ſafely and eaſily deſtroyed; the firſt
Bait to be offered was, the Marriage of the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> the Kings
Siſter, to <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and if that ſucceeded
not, they were to invent ſtill a new Plot, till they found that which would
do the Buſineſs, a Peace was therefore concluded with the Proteſtants, by
which the free Exerciſe of their Religion was granted them, ſome Cautionary
Towns were alſo put into their hands to be kept by them two Years, till there
were a full ſettlement made of the Edicts, and the other things agreed to for
their Security: the next Progreſs in the Treacherous Deſign was, when a
Confidence was begotten on the Faith and Covenants of this Peace in the
Proteſtants, then to draw the chief Heads of the Party to the Court, and they
being ſo flatter'd into their compaſs, they had the Power whenſoever they
thought fit, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and deſtroy them as they pleaſed; the
Proteſtant Admiral <hi>Coligni,</hi> was the firſt whom the King with a
Counterfeit Countenance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and great Donatives, drew to Court;
the Queen of <hi>Navarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

generally believed of Poiſon, that was given her in ſome perfumed Gloves;
to conceal which, the Chirugions that open'd her, would not touch her head,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that ſhe died of an Impoſthume in her ſide; the Cardinal
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion</hi> was alſo at that time poiſon'd, which though after
confeſs'd by him that had done it, yet was not then ſo much as
ſuſpected; the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were
then drawn to Court, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all the ſigns of Friendſhip could
be invented; a Diſpenſation was obtained from the Pope for the Marriage,
and the chief Heads of the Proteſtants were all drawn to <hi>Paris,</hi> on
pretence to aſſiſt at the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Marriage; on the
Seventeenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> was Married, and
four Days were ſpent in all the Bravery of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions that are uſual on
ſuch occaſions, but were now performed with more than ordinary Magnificence
and Joy, there was but one part of the Kings deportment which could give any
ground of Jealouſie, which were the horrid and Blaſphemous Oaths and
Imprecations, which <pb n="243" facs="tcp:49347:134"/>he made Uſe of on all occaſions,
to perſuade them of the Reality of his Profeſſions, which always raiſe
ſuſpitions in ſober and wary Perſons; theſe the King uſed ſo
frequently, that the Writers of that time ſay, he ſeldome ſpoke three
words without ſome Terrible Oath, or Blaſphemous Expreſſion; but it was
now high time to Execute his Deſign, not valuing his Oaths, the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> was therefore put upon it to get the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Admiral
Aſſaſſinated, who imployed therein one <hi>Maurenell</hi> who had
formerly Aſſaſſinated another Perſon for him; this Rogue he placed in
the Houſe of one who had been his Tutor, near St. <hi>German</hi> of
<hi>Auxerre,</hi> where the Admiral uſed to paſs, as he went or came from
the <hi>Louvre;</hi> therefore on the Twenty Second of <hi>Auguſt</hi> about
Noon, as the Admiral was going home from the Court reading a Paper that he had
in his hand, the Aſſaſſinate that was laid for him ſhot him, from the
Houſe where the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had placed him; his Fury was
charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with three Bullets that were believ'd to be poiſon'd, one of theſe
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away part of the Fore-finger, the other ſtruck in his left Arm, the
third miſſed: The King was in the Tennis-Court when the news was brought
him, and Perſonated a deep Reſentment, and ſaid in a Tone ſeeming full
of Affliction, and with a Terrible Oath, <hi>Shall I never have quiet?</hi> and
ſo threw away his Racquet, and went out in a Rage. The Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> did alſo counterfeit ſome Surprize. The King of
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> came to the King to
complain, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his leave to go out of Town, ſeeing men were not
ſafe ſo near the Court; the King ſeemed more to Reſent it than they,
and with the moſt horrible Oaths that he could think of, Swore, he would
Execute ſuch Revenge on all that were found guilty, as ſhould never be
forgotten, and deſired them to ſtay, and be witneſſes of it, and
viſited the Admiral who lay ſick of his Wounds, with great ſhew of
condoleing his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; but in ſhort, after all theſe, and many other
counterfeit Shews, a Council is called by <hi>The Moſt Chriſtian,</hi>
moſt Perjured King, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was Reſolved, That not only the Perſons
of Quality of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould be killed, but every one of what condition
ſoever of that Profeſſion, ſhould be Maſſacred; and amongſt them
violently was moved that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> ſhould run the common Fate of the reſt, till with much ado
moderated, by another Party, that they ſhould be only enforced to change
their Religion, and the Conduct of the whole Buſineſs was committed to the
Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to deſtroy all the Proteſtant Hereticks through
the Kingdom, who firſt ordered a ſtrong Guard to be ſet about the places
where the Admiral and his Friends Lodged, that none might eſcape, and to have
a multitude of Torches and Flambeaux ready, only to light out of their Windows;
and <pb n="244" facs="tcp:49347:135"/>a multitude of Soldiers, whoſe Sign ſhould be a
White Linnen Sleeve on the left Arm, and a White Croſs in their Caps, and the
pretence was, that theſe ſhould ſhew the King a Divertiſement in the
Night; in the Counterfeit Aſſaulting of a Fort, and the time appointed for
the Execution was at Tolling of the Great Bell of the Palace, which ſhould be
done near the break of Day, and then they were to light their Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and
March, the Signal was given the Morning of the 24th. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> St.
<hi>Bartholomew's</hi> Day, being Sunday, part of the Soldiers are ſent to
the Lodgings of the Wounded Admiral, to go through with the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der begun, and
Seven breaking into his Chamber all Armed, there killed him, and the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> being below the Court, bid them to throw him out of the
Window, which was done, and either the Duke, or the Count of
<hi>Angouleſme</hi> (for it is differently reported) wiped his face, for it
was disfigured with Blood, to know if it was be indeed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it was,
trampled on his Belly, and went away; an <hi>Italian</hi> cut off his head, and
carried it to the Queen Mother, and then embalmed it, and ſent it to the
Pope; then all the Ignominy and Barbarity poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was exerciſed on the
Dead Carcaſs, his Fingers and Hands were cut off, his Body dragged about the
Streets, thrown into the Seine, and hanged up in Chains his Feet uppermoſt,
and a Fire was ſet under to burn, which only Roaſted, and conſumed it
not; here the horrible Maſſacre began, and ended not till it had run
through the whole City, and Countrey, with all the moſt Helliſh Butcheries
could be deviſed, one would cut off the Noſe, another the Ear, a third the
Hands, a fourth the Arms of the ſame Party, before they would be ſo
merciful as to kill him. No Degrees, Age, or Sex ſpared, Young or Old, Infant
or Suckling, and a ſingle Death ſatisfied not, till they made them die many
Deaths, and till, as is Eſtimated, there were deſtroyed an Hundred
Thouſand Innocent Proteſtants. The Cruelty of which, was ſo abhor'd by
the Soldiers themſelves, that many of them endeavour'd to ſave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the
Proteſtants; for ſure of all Men the moſt Valiant are the moſt
Merciful; but the more than <hi>Feminine</hi> Cruelty of the

                  <head>Why the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors Marry not by a Prieſt,
or in a Temple; and of the Bloody Murders enſued of the Sons of
<hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent by breaking the Cuſtom, and being drawn by
the Deceit of <hi>Roxolana</hi> to Marry her by a Prieſt.</head>
                  <p>The Reaſons why the Grand Seigniors Marry not themſelves
by a Prieſt, or in a Temple, or by a Magiſtrate, or with any other Publick
Solemnity, but only make Uſe of Private Natural Marriage, are, (1.) It
prevents the great Charge of a Dower or Jointure, which <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors are bound to give their Queens who are Married by a Prieſt; for as
<hi>Withers</hi> Relates, amongſt the Grand Seigniors Seraglio of Women,<note place="margin">Marriage made by the firſt birth of a Child, and not by words of
a Prieſt.</note> ſhe is eſteemed Empreſs who brings him the firſt
Son, and they were formerly Married before the <hi>Mufti,</hi> or
Arch-Prieſt, which was only to give one another their Aſſent before him,
and he to make an <hi>Hodget</hi> or Note in Writing of it, and of the Dower
the Emperor was to give her; which, except as to the Dower, was no other than
as our Certificate of the Biſhop, touching which <hi>Selymus</hi> being
Uxorious, and having given in his Marriage Five Hundred Thouſand Chequins a
Year to his Queen, made a Law, no Succeſſor, if they Married, ſhould give
leſs than he had done to their Queens; whereupon the Emperors ſucceeding
forebore, and it grew out of faſhion to Marry by the Prieſt, to ſave
their Dower and other exceſſive Expences incident to Publick Marriages of
Princes, and had thereby likewiſe their Queens far more obſequious than
before, they thereby depending wholly on the Love of their Husbands to give
them what they pleaſed, according to their merit. (2.) By not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying by a
Prieſt he is clear from all Burden of Allyances of his <hi>Sultana,</hi> Poor
or Rich. (3.) The Grand Seignior thereby regained into his own hands the
<hi>Patria Poteſtas</hi> belonging to every Father, of being Judg who were
his own Children, which had been by his Superſtitious Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
unwarily Alien'd to his <hi>Arch-Mufti</hi> or Arch-Biſhop; for by giving him
Power by his <hi>Hodget</hi> or Certificate to declare the Marriage, there
followed as incident thereto the Arch-Biſhop's Legitimation of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Declaration of his Heir Apparent and Succeſſor. Then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Law allowing Plurality, if Married by the Prieſt they
could not be Married altogether, but one after another; or if they were, a
Child of a Woman Married after might come ſooner, which Priority of Marriage
by the Mother would have deſtroyed the Cuſtom of Primogeniture of the Son
firſt born of any Wife, whether the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved or hated, or firſt Married, or
after Married, ſo (4.) he kept <pb n="246" facs="tcp:49347:136"/>the Right of
Primogeniture and Peace in his own Family, which if he having an Elder Son by a
firſt Wife, not Married by a Prieſt, ſhould have a Younger Son by a
Second Wife Married by a Prieſt, this pretence might cauſe Murder or Civil
Wars between his Elder and Younger Sons, one ſtanding on his Right of
Primogeniture, and the other on the <hi>Hodget</hi> or Certificate of the
Arch-Biſhop, of <hi>Prior</hi> Marriage of the Later Mother by the Prieſt;
as happen'd in the Example of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, and
<hi>Roxolana, Turk, Hiſt.</hi> 758. where it appears that <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
the Magnificent begot of his firſt Empreſs, (a <hi>Circaſſian</hi>
Bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, not Married by a Prieſt) <hi>Muſtapha</hi> his Eldeſt Son,
who proved a Prince of great Excellency, and moſt dearly beloved by the Army
and People; after, <hi>Solyman</hi> according to their Cuſtom of Plurality of
Wives grows wanton, and begets four Sons more of <hi>Roxolana,</hi> another of
his Bond-women, namely <hi>Mahomet, Selymus, Bajazet,</hi> and
<hi>Tzithanger,</hi> and one Daughter called <hi>Chameria,</hi> Married to

having thus cunningly Rid the Court of the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors both of her Love
and the Empire, reſted not ſo, but began ſtraight way to plot in her
malicious head the Deſtruction of him to whom all others wiſhed
Happineſs; and though ſhe had removed him far abſent in his Perſon, yet
the continually encreaſing Fame of his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <pb n="247" facs="tcp:49347:136"/>Vertues
and Perfections, ſeem'd to be ſtill before her Eyes, and in her Ears, the
great and only diſturbance of her Deſires, and Clouds which kept the Sun
from ſhining on them; and doubting of any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Aſſiſtants or

the Devotion of the Prince, and not of <hi>Ruſtan</hi> her Son in Law, whom
they hated, though ſhe had got him to be Chief Commiſſion-Officer over
them; ſhe therefore fixes the other part of her hopes on the Prieſt, and
Reſolves to try what could be ſupplied by the Gown, which was defective in
the Sword; and to prepare the way the better, ſhe on a ſudden Counterfeits
her ſelf to be very Religious, and having grown by the favour of
<hi>Solyman</hi> exceeding Rich, pretended, (as if it had been on a devout
Zeal) for the health of her Soul, after the manner of their <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Superſtition to build an Abby, with an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital and a Church; which ſo
Godly a purpoſe ſhe imparted to the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> or Chief
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Prieſt, demanding of him if ſuch works of Charity were
not acceptable to God, and available to her Souls health? to which the
<hi>Mufti</hi> anſwer'd, That thoſe Works were no doubt gratious in the
ſight of God, but nothing at all meritorious for her Souls health, being a
Bond-woman, yet very profitable for the Soul of the Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Solyman,</hi> unto whom, as unto her Lord, both ſhe and all that ſhe
had appertained; at which anſwer of the great Prieſt ſhe ſeemed to be
exceedingly troubled, and thereupon became wonderful penſive and
Melancholick; her Chearful Countenance was Replete with Sadneſs, and her fair
Eyes flowed with Tears; her Mirth was Mourning, and her Joy Heavineſs; which
thing <hi>Solyman</hi> perceiving, and ſorry to ſee his Love upon Conceit
ſo to languiſh, ſent her word to be of good chear, and to comfort her
ſelf, promiſing in ſhort time to take ſuch a Courſe as ſhould
eaſe her of all her Griefs, of which ſhe had made ſome diſcovery to
him; which he did, ſolemnly Manumiſing her from her Bond Eſtate. So great
a favour obtained, <hi>Roxolana</hi> with great chearfulneſs began thoſe
Meritorious Works by her before intended, as if ſhe had thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Heaven, whereas indeed her thoughts were in the depth of Hell. While ſhe
had thus a good while buſied her ſelf in paving her way to heaven, as was
thought, <hi>Solyman,</hi> not able any longer to forbear the company of her in
whom his Soul lived, after his wonted manner ſent for her by one of his
Eunuchs, who ſhould have brought her to his Bed-Chamber; to whom ſhe with
Eyes caſt up to Heaven demurely anſwer'd, That her Life and whatſoever
ſhe had was at her Dread Sovereign's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but again to yield her Body to
his Appetite, ſhe might not do, without great offence to the High God, and
manifeſt breach of his Laws, which permitted her not now voluntarily to yield
him that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="248" facs="tcp:49347:137"/>a Free-Woman, which he before might
without offence command of his Bond-Woman. And becauſe ſhe would not ſeem
to uſe this as an Excuſe, ſhe referred her ſelf in all things to the
Grave Judgment of the Learned and Revern'd <hi>Mufti,</hi> with whom ſhe
before had at full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd. This ſhe did, preſuming of the Sovereignty
ſhe had over the great Monarch, whom ſhe well knew ſhe had ſo faſt
bound, in pleaſing Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Affection towards her, as that ſhe was
ſure enough of him without a keeper. <hi>Solyman</hi> Raviſhed with her
Love, and the more for her denial, ſent for the <hi>Mufti,</hi> requiring his
Judgment in the matter; who before inſtructed in all points, agreed with what
<hi>Roxolana</hi> had ſaid, aggravating the Heinouſneſs of the Fact, if
he ſhould proceed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force her as his Slave, who being now Free he might
not without great offence touch unmarried; whereupon <hi>Solyman</hi> more and
more burning in his Deſires, became a freſh Suitor to her for Marriage,
whom he had ſo often before Commanded without it; which his Suite eaſily
obtained (as the mark at which ſhe aimed) he with all ſpeed, to the great

Legitimating his own Iſſue, and Peace of their Families, his wiſer
Predeceſſors had ſaved by Marrying themſelves privately, without a

now more buſie than ever, to ſeek means to deſtroy the Prince; and to
that end <hi>Ruftan</hi> gives the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the Governors of
<hi>Syria,</hi> That the old Emperor highly ſuſpected the Prince his Son of
aſpiring to the Empire, bearing them in hand that the more ſuſpitiouſly
they writ concerning the Prince, the leſs ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious the Emperor would
be of his Governors; whereupon theſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors writing of the Princely
Diſpoſition, Wiſdom, Valour, and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Prince, whereby he
courted and won the hearts of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and People, and that it was
probable he would at length thereby at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Empire, <hi>Ruſtan</hi> not
daring to bring any matter on theſe Letters to <hi>Solyman</hi> himſelf,
brought them always to <hi>Roxolana,</hi> and left the reſt to be managed by
her cunning and malitious head, who taking fit opportunity when
<hi>Muſtapha</hi> was talk'd of, with Tears trickling down her Cheeks (which
ſhe could well Command) with aggravating theſe Letters, and other matters
invented, told the Emperor in what Danger he ſtood, recounting amongſt
other things how <hi>Selymus</hi> his Father had <pb n="249" facs="tcp:49347:137"/>by
ſuch means deprived <hi>Bajazet</hi> his Grand-Father, both of his Life and
Empire together, and therfore moſt inſtantly beſought him, as though this
had proceeded from her tender love, by that example to provide for himſelf.
But theſe light matters ſeem'd to <hi>Solyman</hi> of no ſufficient
weight to ground ſo dangerous a ſuſpition on, ſo that ſhe little
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed thereby, which ſhe well perceiving and grieved at, ſhe converted
her Cruel mind to other miſchievious devices, and ſought by all means how
to Poyſon the Innocent Prince, neither wanted there wicked Men for Reward
ready to have performed all that ſhe deſired, had not Gods Providence
withſtood ſo horrible a Practice; for whereas certain Rich Apparrel was by
her ſent to him in his Fathers name; he fearing the worſt, would not touch
it before he had cauſed it to be wore by one of his Servants, by which
curious warineſs (as was thought) he at that time prevented the Treaſon of
his wicked Step-dame, and diſcovered her mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Practice. Yet reſted
ſhe not ſo, but was ſtill Plotting new devices, and at laſt got from
the <hi>Baſſa</hi> who attended the Prince, certain Letters, wherein was
contained that there was a Speech of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the Prince and the
King of <hi>Perſia's</hi> Daughter, which thing he thought good to give

<hi>Ruſtan</hi> go both together to <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> aggravating the danger
of the Ambition of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who under hand ſought Alliance with
the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the old Enemy of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours, and
that he might by the ſtrength of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Sanzacks</hi>
and <hi>Janizaries,</hi> whom he had by large Gifts won to his ſervice,
deprive him in ſhort time both of Life and Empire; and theſe Accuſations
they proſecuted with ſuch continued Importunity, that they never ſuffer'd
the Old Emperour to live quiet till he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſecure his own ſafety
by the death of his Son, in this manner, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. He cauſed an
Army to be Levyed by <hi>Ruſtan,</hi> in pretence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Perſia,</hi> but indeed to ſurprize <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and bring him
bound to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and if he could not, by any other means to
make him out of the way. And in the year. 1553. <hi>Solyman</hi> himſelf in
Perſon marches with the Army againſt his Son, but the Deſign could not be
carryed ſo private, but <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had ſome intelligence of his
Fathers Mortal, though undeſerved hatred againſt him. <hi>Solyman</hi>
lying Incamped at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo,</hi> by Meſſage commanded his Son
<hi>Muſtapha</hi> to come unto him there. This caſt <hi>Muſtapha</hi>
into great perplexity of mind what to do, either to hazard his life by putting
himſelf into his Father Power, or by flight or ſome other way to provide
for himſelf; yet truſting to his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, though wonderfully
troubled in mind, he Reſolved, though <pb n="250" facs="tcp:49347:138"/>with the
extremeſt danger of his life, to obey his Fathers command; thinking it more
honorable to incur danger of death, than living to fall into foul ſuſpition
of diſloyalty. In ſo great a perplexity of mind, after he had with
himſelf much diſcourſed too and fro, what courſe he were beſt to
take, at length he boldly and reſolutely asked the Doctor, whom (as we have
before ſaid) he had always with him in his Court, whether the Empire of the
World, or a Bleſſed life after it were more to be deſired? To whom the
Doctor frankly Anſwered, That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the World, to him that would
enter into the due conſideration thereof, brought with it no Felicity, more
than a vain Show and outward appearance of Good, nothing being more frail and
uncertain than World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honour, bringing with it fear, vexation of mind,
tribulation, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, murder, wrong, wickedneſs, ſpoil, ruin and
captivity, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite miſchiefs of like nature, not to be deſired of
him that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to true Felicity, by which means the Bleſſed life
was to be loſt and not gained: But they unto whom God had given the Grace
rightly to Conſider and Weigh the Fragility and ſhortneſs of this our
Eſtate, (which the Common Sort deemeth to be the only life) and to ſtrive
againſt the Vanities of this World, and to Embrace and Follow an upright kind
of life; had undoubtedly a place Aſſigned for them in Heaven, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by the great God, where they ſhould at length enjoy Life and Bliſs Eternal.
This Anſwer of the great Doctor, wonderfully ſatisfied the troubled mind of
the young Prince, foreſeeing as it were the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his own end: and
ſo ſtaying not any longer Diſcourſe, forthwith ſet forward towards
his Father, and making great haſt, came at length to his Fathers Camp, and
not far off pitched his Tents in the open field, but this his ſo haſty
march the more increaſed the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the mind of his wicked
Father: neither ſpared <hi>Ruſtan</hi> in the mean time with his crafty and
ſubtle devices to Augment the ſame; for by a ſign given he cauſed the
<hi>Janizaries</hi> and chief Men in the Army to go, as if it had been for
Honours ſake, to meet <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> which they all without delay
preſently did at his Command, and ſo altogether ſet forward: in the mean
time he the moſt crafty Varlet, with troubled Countenance (for he could
notably diſſemble) as a Man half diſmayed, came in haſt into
<hi>Solymans</hi> Pavillion, and falſly told him, That the
<hi>Janizaries</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the beſt Souldiers of the Army were of
themſelves without leave gon to meet <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and that he feared
what would enſue thereof. Which news ſo troubled the old Tyrant, that he
became pale for fear, and going out of his Tent, and finding them gone,
eaſily believed all to be true that the falſe <hi>Baſſa</hi> had told
him. Neither wanted <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſtrange warning of his end ſo near
at hand, for the third day before his ſetting forwards towards his Father,
falling a ſleep in the Evening, he <pb n="251" facs="tcp:49347:138"/>thought he ſaw
<hi>Mahomet</hi> his Prophet in Bright Apparrel, to take him by the hand, and
lead him into a moſt pleaſant place, beautified with moſt ſtately and
glorious Palaces, and moſt Delicate and pleaſant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; and pointing to
every thing with his Finger, to ſay thus unto him, Here reſt they for ever,
which in this World have led an upright and Godly life, following vertue, and
deteſting vice. And after that turning his face to the other ſide, to have
ſhewed him two great and ſwift Rivers, whereof the one boiled with Water
blacker than Pitch, and in them appeared (as he thought) numbers of Men
wallowing and tumbling, ſome up, ſome down, crying horribly for Mercy; and
there (ſaid he) are Puniſhed all ſuch as in this frail life have been the
malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workers of Iniquity: The chief of whom (as he ſaid) were
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings, Princes, and other great Men of the World.
<hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> awaking, and troubled with this melancholick Dream, called
unto him his Doctor: and having told him all the matter, asked him, what the
ſame might ſignify? ſtanding a great while in a muſe (for the
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> are exceeding Superſtitious, Attributing much to Dreams)
full of Sorrow and Grief at length Anſwered, That this Viſion (for ſo it
pleaſed him to term it) was undoubtedly to be feared, as preſaging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him the Extream Peril of his life; and therefore Requeſted him, to have great
care both of his Life and Honour. But <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> as he was of a
notable Spirit and Courage, regarding nothing that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſtoutly
Replied, What, ſhall I ſuffer my ſelf to be terrified and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with
Childiſh and Vain fear? Why rather haſt I not Couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and
Reſolutely to my Father? and ſo much the more boldly, becauſe I know
aſſuredly I have always (as Reaſon was) Reverenced his Majeſty, that
againſt his will I never turned mine Eyes or Foot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his moſt Royal
Seat, much leſs affected his Empire, except the moſt high God had called
him to a better life, neither then without the General good likeing and choice
of the whole Army, that ſo at length I might without Murder, without Blood,
without Tyranny well and Juſtly Reign, and in Love and Peace inviolate live
with my Brethren: for I have ſet down with my ſelf and choſen, if it be
my Fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo, rather to die in his obedience, than Reigning many
years, to be reputed of all Men, eſpecially my Competitours, a Rebel or
Traitor. Having thus ſaid, he came unto his Fathers Camp, and pitching his,
(as we have before ſaid) ſuted himſelf all in White, in token of his
Innocency, and Writing certain Letters (which the <hi>Turks</hi> when they are
about to go to any place of Danger uſe to Write, and always to carry with
them (for they are wonderful Fooliſh in their Superſtition) and putting
them in his Boſom, attended upon with a few of his moſt 
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49347:139"/>Truſty followers, came with great Reverence towards the
Tent of his Father, fully reſolving to have kiſs'd his hand, as their
uſual manner is. But when he was come to the Entrance of the Tent,
remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had yet his Dagger girt to him, he entred not, till he had
put it off; becauſe he would not come into his Fathers ſight with any
Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, if happily ſo he might clear himſelf of his Fathers needleſs
ſuſpition; ſo when he was come into the more inward Rooms of the Tent, he
was with ſuch Honour as belonged to his Eſtate chearfully Received by his
Fathers Eunuchs, but ſeeing nothing elſe provided but one Seat whereon to
ſit himſelf alone, he perplexed in mind, ſtood ſtill a while Muſing,
at length asked where the Emperour his Father was? Whereunto they Anſwered,
That he ſhould by and by ſee him: and with that caſting his Eye aſide,
he ſaw Seven Mutes (theſe are ſtrong Men bereft of their Speech, whom the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tyrants have always in readineſs the more ſecretly to
Execute their Bloody Butcheries) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the other ſide of the Tent
towards him, at whoſe ſight ſtruck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with a ſudden Terrour, ſaid no
more, but lo my Death; and with that ariſing, was about to have fled: but in
vain, for he was caught hold on by the Eunuchs and Mutes, and by force drawn to
the place appointed for his Death, where without further ſtay the Mutes
caſt a Bow-ſtring about his Neck, he Poor Wretch ſtill ſtriving, and
requeſting that he might but ſpeak two words to his Father before he died.
All which the Murtherer (for no addition is ſufficient Significantly to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his unnaturall Villany) both heard and ſaw by a Travers from the
other ſide of the Tent: But was ſo far from being moved with
Compaſſion, that thinking it long till he were diſpatched, with a moſt
Terrible and cruel Voice he rated the Villaines enured to Blood, ſaying, will
you never diſpatch that I bid you? Will you never make an end of this
Traitor, for whom I have not Reſted one night theſe ten years in quiet?
which horrible commanding Speeches yet thundring in their Ears, thoſe
Butchering Mutes threw the Poor Innocent Prince upon the Ground and with the
help of the Eunuchs forcibly drawing the knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bow-ſtring both ways by the
Commandment of a moſt wicked Father, ſtrangled him. With like Barbarous
Cruelty, he ſhortly after cauſed <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Nephew
(<hi>Muſtapha</hi> his Son) to be ſtrangled alſo. This unnatural and
ſtrange Murther committed, he preſently Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
of <hi>Amaſia, Muſtapha</hi>'s Lieutenant to be apprehended, and his head
in his own preſence to be ſtruck off; which done, he ſent for
<hi>Trihanger,</hi> yet Ignorant of all that was happened, and in ſporting
wiſe, as if he had done a thing worth Commendations, bid him go meet his
Brother <hi>Muſtapha:</hi> which thing <hi>Trihanger</hi> with a merry and
chearful <pb n="253" facs="tcp:49347:139"/>Countenance haſted to do, as one glad of his
Brother's Coming. But aſſoon as he came unto the place where he ſaw his
Brother lying dead upon the Ground ſtrangled, it is not to be ſpoken how he
was in mind tormented. He was ſcarcely come to the place where this
Deteſtable Murther was Committed, when his Father ſent unto certain of his
Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to offer unto him all <hi>Muſtapha</hi>'s Treaſure, Horſes,
Servants, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, Tents, and withal the Government of the Province
<hi>Amaſia:</hi> But <hi>Trihanger</hi> filled with extream heavineſs for
the unmerciful Death of his well beloved Brother, ſpake unto them in this
ſort, Ah Wicked and Ungodly <hi>Cain,</hi> Traitor (I may not ſay Father)
take thou now the Treaſure, Horſes, the Servants, the Jewels, and the
Province of <hi>Muſtapha.</hi> How come it into thy Wicked, Cruel, and Savage
Breaſt, ſo ungratiouſly and contrary to all Humanity, I will not ſay
the Reverence of thy own Blood, to kill thy Worthy, Warlike and Noble Son, the
Mirrour of Courteſie, and Prince of Greateſt hope, the like of whom, the
<hi>Othoman</hi> Family never yet had, nor never ſhall? I will therefore my
ſelf provide that thou, nor none for thee, ſhall never hereafter in ſuch
ſort ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Triumph over ſuch a Poor Wretch as I am. And having thus
much ſaid, Stab'd himſelf with his own Dagger in the Body, whereof he in
ſhort time dyed: which ſo ſoon as it came to the Old Tygers Ears, it is
hard to ſay how much he grieved. His dead Body was by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Commandment carryed from <hi>Aleppo</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and afterwards Honorably buried on the other ſide
of the Haven at <hi>Pera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence appear the two great benefis the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Emperors receive from not medling at all with the Prieſt, either in
Coronations or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, but as to the firſt, rather wear no Crown at all,
and are content with a Turbant, than receive it from them or their Unctions;
and for their Marriages, take what Wife they like in Private, without them, or
their Solemnities. For firſt the ſparing a Coronation and likewiſe the
Solemnity of any Marriage (which cannot avoid, if publick by a Prieſt, the
forementioned Exceſſes of Apparrel, Tilting, Turneaments, Masking,
Gluttony, Riot, Drunkenneſs, Dowers and Gifts, on the Coronations and
Marriages of ſo great Princes) ſaves him a Vaſt ſome of Money to his
Private Treaſure; and what is a greater benefit than the other, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
his Supremacy againſt the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Mufties</hi> and Caliphs,
who can make no pretence to depoſe him, or take from him or his
Succeſſors that Government, which they never gave him, nor he would receive
from them, or his Sons from their Unctions or Certificates.</p>

<hi>Bak. Hiſt.</hi> 27. (2.) It hath been continued by Judges and Officers of

might write half Words and Daſhes, which the Country Men might not be able to

That motions at Bar and demurrers and arguments in Law may multiply and cut out

Letters or Language of a Forreign Nation. (3.) When they are Letters nor
Language of any Nation, but made by Confederacy between ſome Party or Sect of
Men in the ſame; ſuch are Private Cyphers of Intelligences, and Lawyers
Latine, Terms of <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> School-men, Phyſitians, and Others,

worſe than <hi>Latine</hi> Prayer; for none can be hindred from Praying to
God in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but from Pleading he may to a Judg. So to keep
<hi>Latine</hi> in Courts, keeps all in readineſs to bring it again into 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49347:141"/>Churches, and to turn out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
Foreigners into both. This is very miſchievous in many reſpects, for,
firſt, when a Writ comes to a Biſhop himſelf he underſtands it not, and
may ſooner forſwear himſelf than perform his Duty in it. (2.) When a Writ
comes to the Sheriff he can neither read nor underſtand it, nor many times
his Under-Sheriff, and they likewiſe may both ſooner forſwear
themſelves than perform their Duty. Then it may ſometimes happen to be
ſent to the Coroners, where the Sheriff is a Party, and they are in no better
condition than thoſe before. Then if a <hi>Subpaena</hi> or other Order or
Declaration in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> be ſerved on the Poor Defendant, he runs in a
great affright to one Neighbour, and the other Neighbour, and then at length to
the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter himſelf of the Pariſh, who all cannot read or underſtand
one line of the matter: then muſt he run away to an Attorny, and give him his
Fee, and then to a Councel; and then all the matters are found to be as falſe
in the Fact, as they are in the <hi>Latine,</hi> and only done for vexation of
the poor Man; and this he might have known in his own Pariſh, if it had been
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> without being put to what is to him a great coſt and
trouble: Then, if it happen the matter to be true, and it come to Tryal at the
<hi>Niſi Prius,</hi> the Iſſue is in <hi>Latine</hi> and Court-hand, ſo
are the <hi>Pleas</hi> and <hi>Declaration,</hi> there is not a man in the Jury
can read a word of it, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goes by Implicite Faith to whatever the
Councel for Hire inform them, and are in as great danger of Perjury, as the
Sheriff and his Under-She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff were before. Then turn over to the Crown ſide,
the Bills of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment are all in <hi>Latine,</hi> the Witneſſes bound
over to proſecute can neither Read nor Write, much leſs underſtand
<hi>Latine,</hi> the malicious proſecutor puts what he will in the Bill, the
Witneſſes Swear to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and are Perjur'd for the poor
Countrey men if it be <hi>Latine,</hi> and the Juſtice of Peace that binds
them over, thinks they ought to Swear to the Bill of Indictment, let it be what
it will, or they ſhall forfeit their Recognizance; and ſeeing they can
neither read nor underſtand it, thinks they muſt Swear by Implicite Faith.
And many times even ſome of the Grand-Jury may not be ſo well skill'd in
Law-<hi>Latine,</hi> but were it not by Implicite Faith only to their fellows
<hi>Billa Vera,</hi> they would, if the Bill were in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> find
an <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> So likewiſe Church-wardens commonly think it lawful to
forſwear themſelves, if it be done in a word of <hi>Latine.</hi> I knew one
who uſed when he had been cited to make Preſentment according to the Charge
in the Book of Articles, to the Biſhops Court, he uſed always at his Return
from Court, to boaſt that he had preſented <hi>omine bene,</hi> and thought
his Conſcience well diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether all was ill or well, as long as he
preſented ſomething in his kind of <hi>Latine</hi> which he underſtood
not. The Evils are likewiſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <pb n="258" facs="tcp:49347:142"/>enough, in
keeping up ſtill this old Popiſh Language in the written. Inſtruments of
Bonds, Charters and Patents; you ſhall not have a Bond in <hi>Latine</hi>
written by an ordinary Clerk or Scribe in the Countrey, but he is apt to
miſtake; ſometimes he will write <hi>Wiginti</hi> for <hi>Viginty,
Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta</hi> for <hi>Quadringenti, Quinquaginta</hi> for
<hi>Quinginti,</hi> or the like; or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the Daſhes, for if thoſe
too be not <hi>More Clericorum,</hi> 'tis as bad as falſe <hi>Latine;</hi>
yea, to put in true <hi>Latine,</hi> where they uſe to write it falſe, may
be dangerous; for you run a hazard, either to loſe your Money, or to fall
into the miſery of a Common Law Demurrer, or a <hi>Chancery</hi> Suite, which
coſts many times more than the Principal is worth, to recover, it. Then
further, if the Obligor or Obligee underſtand not <hi>Latine,</hi> nor can
examine the Writing to be Sealed, the Scrivener or Clerk may take Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of one
part, and Cheat the other as he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>Then as for <hi>Latine</hi> in Charters and Patents, they
are Penn'd in ſuch obſolete, uncouth, and Barbarous Terms, that the King is
many times abuſed and deceived in his <hi>Graunt,</hi> and the
<hi>Grauntees</hi> likewiſe; and fall often into tedious and waſtful Suites
about a word, which if they had been in <hi>Engliſh</hi> would never have
been nor happen'd. As bad miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs likewiſe often fall out by the
Phyſician's uſing this Popiſh Language in his Bills, as by the Lawyers;
for the Apothecaries Boys, though they have been at School, know not all the
words in the Dictionary, nor can they find there the Barbarous Words and Terms
of <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, nor their Antick and
unneceſſary Notes or Characters of Weights and Meaſures: So that
oftentimes by miſtake, either of the Ingredient or Doſe, many a Patient is
thereby Poiſon'd and kill'd, and be he Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or Papiſt, they find
alike, that their Implicite Faith in the Doctors <hi>Latine</hi> did not
ſave, but deſtroy them; though they come not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain after they are
dead.</p>
                     <p>Again, to keep Laws and Judgment in <hi>Latine,</hi> ſhews
that Biſhops are not (as they falſely pretend) Succeſſors to Chriſt,

To Judg a Nation therefore in an unknown Tongue, is Anti-Chriſtian, and
Anti-Apoſtolick. Though the <hi>Turk</hi> prohibites Tranſlation of his
<hi>Alcoran</hi> out of the <hi>Arabick</hi> Tongue into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Language, yet he permits the People to have matters of Juſtice admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to them in their own Tongue. In old <hi>Rome</hi> the Forms of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and
Judicial Proceedings, were for many Ages kept hid by the Prieſts in ſecret,
amongſt the pretended Sacred Rites and Ceremonies of their gods; which
matters of Religion and Juſtice were by moſt of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prieſts kept
in a Language unknown to the People, under the name of a Sacred Language, and
only underſtood by the Prieſts; one of theſe Books of Forms <hi>Cneius
Flavius,</hi> a Clerk to one of the Prieſts, Copied or Tranſlated; and
Publiſhed one, to the great Indignation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and of all the

to the People, that they advanced him to great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and made him a
<hi>Curule Aedile,</hi> only for doing the ſame. In the Councils of

made all Juſtice ſaleable for Bribes; whereat <hi>Bajazet</hi> grievouſly
inraged, commanded divers of the ſame Judges to be apprehended, determining
to the Terror of others to have executed them, whoſe dangerous Eſtate was
much pitied by <hi>Alis Baſſa</hi> and other Courtiers, they perhas
ſelling their Places to them, and thereby forceing them to ſell Juſtice
to others; yet none of them durſt adventure, ſeeing <hi>Bajezet</hi> was of
a furious Nature, and in his Anger dangerous to be ſpoken with, to mediate in

                        <p>There was at that time in the Court an <hi>Aethiopian</hi>
Jeſter, who under ſome Covert pleaſant Jeſt, would often times bolt out
to the King in his greateſt heat, what his graveſt Councellors durſt not
ſpeak to him in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. This Jeſter <hi>Alis Baſſa</hi> requeſted
to deviſe ſome means to entreat the angry King in behalf of theſe Judges,
promiſing to give him what he would deſire, if he could appeaſe the Kings
diſpleaſure. The <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> without fear undertook the matter,
and preſently put on his Head a rich Hat, all wrought over with Gold, and,
accoutred in all other his Cloths ſuitably, preſented himſelf before the
King with a great counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Gravity; whereat <hi>Bajazet</hi> marveling,
asked him the cauſe why he was ſo Gay. I have a Requeſt unto your
Majeſty; ſaid he, and wiſh to find favour in your ſight.
<hi>Bajazet</hi> more deſirous than before to know the matter, asked what his
Requeſt was. If it ſtand with your pleaſure ſaid the
<hi>Aethiopian,</hi> I would fain go as your Ambaſſador to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in hope whereof I have put my ſelf in this
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs. To what purpoſe wouldſt thou go? ſaid <hi>Bajazet.</hi> To
crave of the Emperor ſome Forty or Fifty of his old grave Monks and Friers to
bring with me hither to the Court. And what ſhould they do here? ſaid
<hi>Bajazet.</hi> I would have them placed, ſaid the Jeſter, in the rooms
of the old doteing Judges, whom you intend as I hear to put to death. Why,
ſaid <hi>Bajazet,</hi> I can place others of my own People who are better, in
their rooms. True, ſaid the <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> for Gravity of Look and
Countenance; and ſo would the old Monks and Friers ſerve as well, but not
ſo learned in the Laws and Cuſtoms of your Kingdom as are thoſe 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49347:143"/>in your diſpleaſure. If they are Learned, why do they
then (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Learning) pervert Juſtice, and take Bribes? There is
a good reaſon for that too, ſaid the Jeſter. What reaſon? ſaid the
King. That can he that there ſtandeth by, tell better than I, ſaid the
Jeſter, pointing to <hi>Alis Baſſa,</hi> who, forthwith commanded by
<hi>Bajazet</hi> to give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with great Reverence firſt done,
ſhewed that thoſe Judges ſo in diſpleaſure were not conveniently
provided for, and were therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced many times for their neceſſary
maintenance to take Rewards where they could get them, to the ſtaying of the
due courſe of Juſtice; which <hi>Bajazet</hi> underſtanding to be true,
commanded <hi>Alis Baſſa</hi> to appoint them convenient ſtipends for
their maintenance, and forthwith granted their Pardon. Whereupon the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> ſet down Order, That of every matter in Suit exceeding One
Thouſand Aſpers, the Judges ſhould have Twenty Aſpers; which Fees they
yet take to this day. Whence may be Obſerved,</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) That to place Judges in Courts to undergo the
inceſſant labours of hearing multitudes of Cauſes, and not to allow them
honourable maintenance, is the ready way to make men of ordinary Principles
Freebooters, and to take the Prey for themſelves. So the meanneſs of the
Salary in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> being but an Hundred Marks <hi>per Annum,</hi>
makes the Judges extream Extortious on the People.</p>
                        <p n="2">(2.) That thoſe who buy either Judicial or
Miniſterial places in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, muſt ſell again; and the ſale of
either is contrary to the Law of God, and of infinite Damage to the Publick,
turning the weights of Juſtice to the falſe weights of Merchandize, as
ſays the Poet,

the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>As to the Common Law; it appears 4. <hi>H.</hi> 6.17.

be ſatisfied; for they cannot ſell the Diſtreſs; which ſhews that the
Common Law eſteemed Diſtreſs an Execution after Judgment, though it had
not the Power to ſell the Diſtreſs, as the Civil Law had. That it is an
Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore after Judgment, both by Civil and Common Law is clear.

it ſelf, after Judgment, was more Juſt and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, than the Papal and
Epiſcopal is now with us before Judgment; for firſt they were ſo far from
Arreſting before Demand, and before Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they could not Arreſt
the Defendant on Hearing, and Trial, and Judgment paſs'd againſt him,
without giving him Monition of the Judgment, and till Thirty Days <hi>Juſti
dies</hi> to provide the Money were expired: but now, on a bare Bond before
Judgment, and before ſo much as a Demand made, they caſt into the Goal the
Husbandman from his Plow, the Tradeſman from his Shop, and the Merchant from
the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, without giving the leaſt notice, Thirty or ſo much as Three
Days to provide the Money, whereby they and their Families, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and Trade are oftentimes deſtroyed, not only to the ruin of themſelves, but
great damage of the Publick; for the greateſt bulk of Trade of the Nation
being driven on Money borrowed on Intereſt, if it be intended what is
borrowed ſhould be applied to Trade, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that they can pay
intereſt for it to the Creditor, if they muſt keep it at their Chambers for
the Creditors to call it in again on an hour's warning, or as they now do
without any warning at all; and imploy it at their Trade they cannot, unleſs
they may have at leaſt warning for ſo ſmall a pittance of Time as Thirty
Days, which the very Heathen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Debtors to be free from Arreſt,
though Judgment was paſt againſt them. This abominable Cruelty of beginning
Suits with Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, came not therefore from the Heathen, but from the
pretended Chriſtian <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops and Clerks,<note place="margin">All At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, Diſtreſſes, Exactions of Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Bail,

Judgment before Hearing, Diſtreſs, Attachment, and Arreſt before
Judgment, was brought into <hi>Great Britain</hi> by the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Biſhops, appears by theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: (1.) Becauſe the Regiſter of
Writs (that old <hi>Romiſh</hi> Idol; to which more innocent Cauſes and
Perſons have been Sacrificed and Deſtroyed, according to the proportion of
the Territory it Commands, than to the <hi>Turkiſh Alcoran</hi>) is in

all the Original Proceſs of Summons, Attachment; and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringas are

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments <pb n="267" facs="tcp:49347:146"/>by Inquiſition. (2.) Becauſe all old
Formalities of Entries and Pleadings, of Inſtruments, and Contracts Publick
and Private were Originally in <hi>Latine,</hi> which ſhews they were formed
by <hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops or their Clerks in their own Language, conform
to their <hi>Romiſh</hi> Idol the Regiſter, beginning with Execution, as

Clauſes and Conventions of Diſtreſs, Reentry, Penalties and Forfeitures,

<hi>Romiſh</hi> Biſhops have been Chancellors in that Court which is
<hi>Officina Brevium,</hi> the Shop of Writs, where they are forged; and have
been likewiſe chief Judges in the other Courts of the King, keeping all their
Proceedings in <hi>Latine,</hi> Court-hand, and Chancery-hand, ſecret from
the underſtanding of King and People, whereby they exerciſed what Tyranny
and Oppreſſion they pleaſed. (4.) Becauſe they and other
Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, as Abbots, Priors, and the like, have
Poſſeſs'd the Third part of all the Baronies, Honors, and Mannors in the
Land, and, had they not been ſtopt by the Statutes of <hi>Mortmain,</hi>
might by this time have got all; this way therefore of taking Diſtreſs,
Penalties, and Forfeitures before Judgment, advanced their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in

Prieſts, and Parliaments, in time of Popery, have been ſo far deceived by
them to confirm their Superſtitious Formularies in the Temporal Courts in
ſo high a degree, as now the Temporal Judges are not able to Reform, without
the Aſſiſtance of an Act of Parliament. But I ſhall firſt prove, that
the ſaid Forms are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures, and Anti-Chriſtian. The
Texts of Scripture follow.</p>

forgiven by his Lord Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Talents, Verſe 28: <hi>Went out, and
found one of his fellow-ſervants which ought him an Hundred Pence: and he
laid hands on him, and took him by the Throat, ſaying, Pay me that thou
oweſt. And his fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant fell down at his feet, and beſought him,
ſaying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but
went and caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon, till be ſhould pay the Debt.</hi> Verſe
32. <hi>Then his Lord, after that he had called him, ſaid unto him, O thou
wicked Servant, I forgave thee all that Debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me:
Shouldeſt not thou alſo have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on thy fellow-ſervant,
even as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the
Tormenters, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>From all which may be infer'd,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That no man ought to be Summon'd before a
Judg, till a Copy of the Plaintiffs Declaration be firſt given him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Chriſt ſaith, If thy Brother Treſpaſs againſt
thee, go and tell him his Fault between thee and him alone; which is fully
performed by giving him a Copy of the Declaration or Bill of Complaint, and
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it the ſame cannot be done, nor the full State of the Caſe be
Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, nor he take time of deliberation for an Anſwer. And
from this Precept of Chriſt will follow, firſt, the Ordaining of <hi>Editio
&amp; vocatio in jus ſimul ex continenti,</hi> by the Popiſh <hi>Theodor
an</hi> Biſhops; in <pb n="270" facs="tcp:49347:148"/>the Civil Law is a corruption and
deſtroying of the Excellent Law of the Twelve Tables, <hi>Si in jus voces

                           </expan> eat,</hi> which is already proved to have implied a Preceding
<hi>Oblatio Libelli,</hi> and was the clear Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and immutable in
all Civil Actions.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) That the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of including
the Libel in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, though it far excel our Summons by Writs, yet it is
not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as the Precepts of Chriſt, to make the <hi>Oblatio
Libelli,</hi> or to give the Copy of the Declaration to the Defendant before
Summons; for firſt, he muſt be forced to ſend many times Hundreds of
Miles to a Judg to get a Summons, before the Return of which, all the
buſineſs if there is no Contumacy, may be far better agreed and ended
between him and his Brother at home. Secondly, If there is no Contumacy (as
there can be none, before a Copy of the Declaration delivered, by which the
Demand is made) it is unjuſt to lay ſuch a Puniſhment on a Defendant, to
run Hundreds of Miles to his great Coſt and Trouble in <hi>England,</hi> to
appear before a Judg at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and when he comes there, no
Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> nor any Declaration at Common Law, is put againſt
him. And in <hi>Scotland</hi> to appear at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> at a longer day,
when he was ready and tender'd to ſatisfie his Brother at home in a
ſhorter, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, only to put him to Charge and Vexation. Thirdly,
It is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and unjuſt, that the Plaintiff ſhould be compell'd to
ſend ſo far for ſuch a Trivial Formality as the hand of a Judg to his
Libell'd Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or to expect no Judicial aſſiſtance from it, if he
<hi>gratis</hi> make <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio Libelli,</hi> as Chriſt Commands; for if,
as is the Modern practice in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lords of the Seſſion
never read a word of the Libell'd Summons, and they may be Blaſphemy or
Treaſon for ought they know, yet they ſet their hands to them as faſt as
they can be brought, and I have my ſelf ſet my hand to Hundreds of them;
and that courſe of Summoning being by Act of Parliament made in time of
Popery, which we had no power to alter, I thought that kind of Juſtice better
than none at all: though before <hi>Oblatio Libelli</hi> it ſerves to no more
Uſe than our <hi>Latitat</hi> and <hi>Subpoena</hi> Offices, and others, to
have a pretence of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Money for the People for doing nothing, and
perhaps (if all Truth were ſpoken) for doing Miſchief. Fourthly, If, as the
ancient Practice was of Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> when he was Chancellor of
<hi>England,</hi> who uſed to read over, himſelf in Perſon, every Bill
was prefer'd in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and conſider whether it were juſt or no,
before he would grant a Summons of <hi>Subpoena;</hi> and of <hi>Skene</hi> in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who, as I have been informed there, would likewiſe read
the Bills himſelf before a Summons was granted, and if he found them not fit,
would tear them in pieces, and throw them over the Bar. It hath been therefore
to no <pb n="271" facs="tcp:49347:148"/>purpoſe for the Plaintiff to have ſent to
Judges for Summons, who might ſee that Injuſtice in his Bill which the
Defendant perhaps might not ſee, or might be willing to paſs by, if it had
been firſt ſhewn to him at home. Fifthly, It is unjuſt for the Plaintiff
to make his <hi>Oblatio Libelli</hi> firſt to the Judg, and to get a Summons
thereon before he doth it to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, for the Defendant may, perhaps, if
ſhewn him, ſhew the Plaintiff ſo juſt exceptions againſt the Bill, as
may ſatisfie the Plaintiff himſelf, and ſave both Parties the Trouble and
Coſt of going further to Law; or he may amend his Bill on ſuch exceptions,
and if he think it juſt after amended, inſiſt on the ſame further; to
ſhew his bill firſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the Defendant, though his Enemy, if he
will except againſt it, is more profitable to the Plaintiff for amendment,
than if he ſhewed it his own Councel; for a Friend may never ſhew the Party
his Faults as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy will: As it is more Juſt, ſo it is therefore more
ſafe, firſt to make the <hi>Oblatio Libelli</hi> to the Defendant, before
it be done to the Judg. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The <hi>Juſti dies,</hi> or time of
Returning an Anſwer, cannot be agreed without great Trouble and Coſt,
unleſs there be firſt an <hi>Emparlance</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties, without
troubling the Judg. Againſt offend the taking out of Execution on Judgment
acknowledged by aſſent, and on Recognizances, and Statutes in
<hi>England,</hi> and on Regiſtred Bonds in <hi>Scotland</hi> without
Summons, or <hi>Oblatio Libelli,</hi> or Warning, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Seventhly,
Becauſe Judges uſe to take Caution, or <hi>Plegii de proſequendo</hi> of
the Plaintiff, and the like Pledges of the Defendant, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to hinder
Agreement according to Chriſt, and to ſet them by the Ears to get in Fees
to the Court.</p>

his own Carver of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution by Pledges and Diſtreſſes, on his own
Authority, without the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Judg. Secondly, Otherwiſe the Aſs of
the Fatherleſs, the Ox of the Widow, and the Pledg of the Poor, would be

Convenotinal Pledges, yet they are not able to give beſides Judicial Pledges,
when they are enforced to ſue for their Conventional, unjuſtly ſeized and
detained from them; nor though they are able to Mortgage the Right of their
little Living, to be ſeized when they fail paying Intereſt for the Debt,
yet are they not able to leave Poſſeſſion by which they muſt live, if
the Creditor unjuſtly enter before a Judgment Declaratory, and a true Account
made by him, and a Return of the over-plus, whereto <pb n="273" facs="tcp:49347:149"/>the
Mortgage amounted above the Debt. So though a Poor man is able, to grant a
Rent-charge and a Clauſe of Diſtreſs, if he be in Arere on paying
Intereſt for the Debt, yet if the Creditor wrongfully or exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
Diſtrain, he is not able on a <hi>Replevin</hi> to give Pledges <hi>de

of, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Goods or Lands, Pledged for Debt or Rent, or made liable by any
Covenant or Clauſe Irritant, to forfeiture for non payment of the ſame,
before a Judgment Declaratory of the non payment, and of the value of the Goods
to be Diſtrained; and Lands Seized for ſatisfaction of the ſame, is as

Chriſt intended to relieve the oppreſſion of the Poor againſt the Rich,

Rich, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can give Bail on every unjuſt Suit of theirs, to Exact
Bail of Poor men before Judgment, who are not able to give it, fills

them not a farthing, and he being once Arreſted, and not able to give Bail,
he muſt therefore Rot or Starve in Gaol, or pay whatever the other will ask,

contrary to the Judicial Precepts of Chriſt. And this Humanity and Mercy to
Priſoners that are Poor and unable to pay, hath ſo far prevailed amongſt
moſt Nations, and with the Civil Law, and with the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that in all theſe,<note place="margin">Ceſſio Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> if a

on Oath to the Creditor, he ought to be ſet at liberty; and certainly, the
Arreſting of Debtors without giving warning, or time neceſſary, and who
are not able to pay before Judgment, or detaining them in Priſon after
Judgment, is not only, as hath been already ſaid, hurtful to the Creditor
himſelf; but to the Publick, the ſame being deſtructive to Trade, and
likewiſe to the Peace; for Civil Wars and Seditions have been cauſed both
in the <hi>Grecian, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and many other Commonwealths, by the Cruel
Proſecution and Impriſonments by Creditors of their Debtors; and I remember
we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived often advertiſement from our Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to
deſire us to reſtrain our Letters of <hi>Caption</hi> from Arreſts of
Debtors, and that we fill'd the oppoſite Army who were then in Hoſtility
againſt us, with greater Recruits of Debtors, who fled from Arreſts, than
they had been ever able of their Power to have done, and of Debtors ſo Potent
(for the Privilege of Peers to be free from Arreſt, was then taken away) as
drew multitudes with them to the Hills, who would, if ſecured from Arreſt,
have all ſtayed quiet Neuters at home.</p>

why more Judges than one ought not to be admitted in any one Court, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in

                        <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe as to Election of the Judges, it is

all to the Preſident, while they either talk with one another more pleaſant

the Vote of the Chief Juſtice hear it againſt the other, yet one mans
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being as good as another, yea the Puiſne Juſtice being oftentimes
of greater Age and Ability than the Chief, his Sentence will not carry the
Reputation of Juſtice, neither may it be thought worth the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Coſt
to have an Aſſociate joined with him, if his Vote muſt be null'd by the
others, he had been better at firſt ſate and Sentenced alone; and of more
eſteem his Sentence would have been, had it never been oppoſed by a
contrary Sentence of greater eſteem than that, to help which, there hath been
ſometime added a Fifth Judg in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where the number of the Lords of the Seſſion or Judges was Fifteen, with a

Imparity ſo much to be found, as in one who cannot be divided in the leaſt

Writs, and of all Commiſſions of Rebellion, and of all Outlawries, of all
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Slavery of Sheriffs in making Pannels, and of Free-holders
ſerving in Juries, and of <hi>Niſi Priuſes,</hi> and of Councels
ſpeaking to matters of Fact before Juries. And that three Judges are
ſufficient to do this, and many matters more, I ſpeak by experience; for
there were but four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judges ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and ſometimes there were but three, and ſometimes but two, there the other
ſerving in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they fell out, and occaſion required, and we
diſcharged all the Offices of Lords of the Seſſion, Lords of the
<hi>Exchequer,</hi> and of the Juſtitiar General in his Juſtice-Eir, and in
his particular Juſtice-Courts, which did anſwer all the Offices and Power
of the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> of the <hi>Chancery, Kings-Bench,
Common-Pleas,</hi> and <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> and of the Juſtices of
Gaol-Delivery in their Circuit, and beſides theſe, we Diſcharged the
Commiſſion for Plantation of Kirks through all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were
Viſitors of the Univerſities; there were Judges likewiſe of the
Seiſures of all Ships except <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Importing any Goods of the
Production of <hi>Aſia, Africa, America,</hi> or <hi>Europe,</hi> contrary to
an Act made 1651. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. for Increaſe of Shipping, and
encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Navigation; we likewiſe Diſcharged a Commiſſion of
Claims, and a Commiſſion for moderating the Fines laid on Perſons who had
been in Hoſtility, to a Third part; we likewiſe Diſcharged a
Commiſſion to Elect all Chief Officers in the Boroughs, and made all the
Sheriffs of <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet had we not above Six Hundred Pound <hi>per
Annum</hi> for all this, and about Two Hundred Pounds to bear the Charge of a
Circuit, which was no profit to us, but ſpent in entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the
Publick Honour; neither did we take any Preſent, Treat; or Entertainment from
the Sheriffs, though of our own making, and much leſs any Bribe, or ſo much
as <hi>Eſculenta,</hi> or <hi>Poculenta</hi> from them, or any other; now
that which made it poſſible to us to Diſcharge ſo many Courts, Offices
and Commiſſions, was, that we were ſaved the labour of having Cauſes
toſſed and tumbled from <hi>Chancery</hi> to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, the
<hi>Chancery</hi> and Common Law being there united, and Pleas of Equity
admitted in the ſame Court, and there being no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <pb n="283" facs="tcp:49347:154"/>in Civil Actions, the ſame Perſons were Judges of Fact, Law and
Equity; another cauſe was, that there were no Original Writs, but the more
compendious and juſt way of Summons uſed, by ſerving the Defendant with a
Copy of the Declaration; another cauſe was, that Councel could not ſpeak to
matter of Fact in Civil Actions before Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or at <hi>Niſi Priuſes,</hi>
there being none, nor was ſo much as one of them ſuffer'd to ſpeak or
appear at the Bar when the Depoſitions of Witneſſes are Adviſing or
Reading, as they do with us at <hi>Chancery</hi>-Hearings, to the intolerable
charge of Suitors, and deſtruction of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Equity; another cauſe
was, that the Councel firſt excepted to the Law, which we call a Demurrer,
and after that to the Fact, which we call a Plea, and had that liberty given,
both to demur and plead, which kept the way ſo clear before them, that they
had never any Delays by Jeofails, Repleaders, Arreſts of Judgment, or Writs
of Error; another cauſe was, that both Parties and Advocates took the Oath of
Calumny, that they believed their Allegiance juſt and true, <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud
juretur quod lis ſibi juſta videtur,</hi> which Oath keeps their
Allegiances clean from falſity, that I never found ſo much as one Fiction
in all their judicial Proceedings; and if the ſame Oath were but taken here
as there, I believe there would not one Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> or
Declaration at Common Law come in for Twenty, which now are thruſt in by
heaps; many other cauſes there are, which leſſen the labour of a Judg,
and of the Suitors, which for Brevity I omit; all which ſhew the Prudence of
that Noble Kingdom, where the People enjoy ſo great Juſtice with ſo
little Coſt and Contention; Laſtly, we could have done more Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
than we did, had we been ſet to Act as the <hi>Roman</hi> Judges, every one
ſingle, without Aſſociates in a Court by himſelf; and how great an
Addition to the Publick Treaſury, as well as advantage to Juſtice, the
leſſening the number of Judges, and turning Fees to Salary will cauſe, is
already mention'd.</p>

                  <p>The Oath of Calumny may by the Civil Law be required, not only

                  <p>The Cauſes which introduce Fictions and Falſities into

and after them with the Sheriffs; which Earls and other Lay-Judges in time of
Popery were only Aſſeſſors or Executioners of the Sentence of the
Biſhop, and he only the pretended infallible Oracle both of Law and Goſpel
to Judg how he pleaſed. (2.) Becauſe what is a good exception againſt a
Common Law Judg, is a good exception againſt a Spiritual Judg; and what
Fiction is a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt <hi>Succeſſion</hi> by the Verdict
of the Jury, is a good excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt <hi>Succeſſion</hi> by the
Certificate of a Biſhop. (3.) Becauſe by a kind of Conſpiracy between the
Spiritual and Common Law Courts in time of Popery, their Prepoſterations,
Fictions and Formalities are ſo complex'd and intangled one with another,
that 'tis impoſſible to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them, or carry on a perfect Diſcourſe
of one without the other, or of Prepoſteration without Fiction and Formality;
the one being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cauſe of the other. (4.) It is neceſſary to
prevent any Excuſe the Spiritual Judg may pretend; if he ſhould ſay, The
Common Law Judg is ſuffer'd to Summon and Arreſt before Copy, to Copy
before Oath of Calumny, and to uſe Hundreds of Fictions and Falſities in
his Judicial Proceedings, and why ſhould not the Spiritual Judg be allowed as
well as he? but where they are both cenſured, they can neither recriminate.
And how guilty they both are of nurſing that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous brood of the old

particulars following: The <hi>Subpoena</hi> in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> is a Writ or

Mortal Feud between the Chancellor and the Lord, muſt be a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
<q>Whereas there hath been of late a Bill of Complaint exhibited into the

thought good to give you notice thereof rather by theſe my private Letters,
than by awarding his Majeſties Ordinary Proceſs.</q> This, if no Bill is

Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <pb n="293" facs="tcp:49347:159"/> had an Imperial Authority over the Commons,
and only Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious over the Nobles, and was a Fiction, if he derived his
Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the King, of the weakneſs of the Royal Power, and of a
Diſhonour to it, as if it was not able to do Juſtice to the Commons
againſt the Nobles, as well as to the Nobles againſt the Commons; if a
Sheriff at Common Law ſhould Execute his <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> and
his <hi>Praecipe quod faciat</hi> (whereby he is will'd by the King to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
thoſe againſt whom thoſe Writs are directed) by writing his humble
Letters, when he perceives they concerned Noble-men, to pray their Lordſhips
to do what he was appointed to command, the Law makes him liable to high
puniſhment; and why a Chancellor ſhould not be liable to the ſame, who
commits the ſame offence, and having the Kings Proceſs to command in his
hand, will not, or dares not adminiſter Equity by the ſame equal Proceſs,
to his Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects both Poor and Rich, appears no reaſon, or rather
an higher, <hi>Quanto Major qui peccat habetur,</hi> by how much greater the

Bill in <hi>Chancery</hi> for want of the Oath of Calumny is known to be

that it compels the Anſwer to be longer than it ſelf; for every Lie muſt
be Anſwer'd as well as the Truth; and by reaſon of ſuch Prolixity,
neither the Chancellor, as he ought to do, will take the pains to read, nor the

                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for the Rape of a Woman out of <hi>N.</hi> &amp;c. and
Rehearſed the effect of the Act, and how by the ſame Proceſs was granted
to be made to the Sheriff of <hi>E:</hi> to make certain proclamations in a

Appearance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and after the ſaid <hi>John</hi> was taken, and
in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> committed to the <hi>Marſhals-Ward</hi> for
certain Cauſes, on which a Tranſcript of the Act, and a Mittimus was ſent
out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> directed to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon the
<hi>Marſhal</hi> was charged with him for the ſame Condemnation contained
in the Act, and the ſaid Priſoner comes now and alledges by his Councel,
That the Act of Parliament is not ſufficient, and therefore prays to be
diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Bill being directed to the Commons,
paſs'd them well, and was endorſed in this Form, <hi>Let it be delivered to
the Lords;</hi> but whereas the Bill was, <hi>That the ſaid</hi> John
<hi>ſhould render himſelf before the Feaſt of</hi> Pentecoſt <hi>next
enſuing;</hi> the Lords endorſed the Bill in this Form, <hi>The Lords
grant, that in caſe he appear not before the Feaſt of</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,
<hi>which ſhall be</hi> Anno Domini, 1452. &amp;c. <hi>to wit, at</hi>

granted by the Commons, in which Caſe, the Commons ought to have had the Bill
deliver'd back again to them and they to have aſſented to the Grant of the
Lords, which was not done; and therefore ſuch Act of Parliament is void.
<hi>Forteſcue, It ſeems we ought to intend no otherwiſe but that the Act
is good, for the King hath written to us by his Writ, and hath certified unto
us, That the Bill is confirmed by Authority of Parliament.</hi> Illingworth
<hi>Chief Baron, This cannot here be intended as you ſay; for the Writ which
is made only by a Clerk of the</hi> Chancery, <hi>cannot make an Act of

<hi>But if any Bill is particular, or other Bill, which is firſt deliver'd to
the Commons and paſs'd, they uſe to endorſe the Bill in this Form,</hi>
Let it be deliver'd to the Lords; <hi>and if the King and the Lords agree to
the Bill without changing it, then they uſe not to endorſe the Bill, but
the ſame is deliver'd to the Clerk of the Parliament to be Inrolled; and if
it be a Common Bill it ſhall be Inrolled and enacted; but if it be a
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Bill, it ſhall not be Inrolled, but Filed on a File, and it is
well enough; but if the Party will Sue to have the ſame Enter'd for his
better Security, it is well enough, it may be Inroll'd; and if the Lords will
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Bill, that which may ſtand with the Grant of the Commons ſhall
not be deliver'd back to them; as, if they will grant Tonnage and Poundage for

redeliver'd to the Commons, becauſe 'tis conſiſtent with their Grant; but
if</hi> Vice Verſa, <hi>the Commons grant for Two Years, and the Lords for

into the Commons after the Feaſt of</hi> Pentecoſt, <hi>which was in
Parliament time, and the intent of the Bill was, That the Proclamations
ſhould laſt till the Feaſt of</hi> Pentecoſt <hi>then next enſuing,
which was</hi> Anno 1452. <hi>but every Bill of Parliament ſhall have

not?</hi> Faukes, <hi>Truly, I do think ſo,</hi> &amp;c. Markham, <hi>Do you

Faukes, <hi>No Sir.</hi> Markham, <hi>Verily this is a Perilous thing, for the
Court of Parliament is the Moſt High Court the King hath, and it were well
done, if every Act and Thing there done, which is material, and reaſon of it,
were Inrolled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For in this Caſe, if the Bill paſs'd the
Commons and the Lords in the manner <pb n="300" facs="tcp:49347:163"/>aforeſaid, before
the Feaſt of</hi> Pentecoſt, <hi>then the Act is void, becauſe of the

the Bill,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it was not redeliver'd to the Commons, but it
was deliver'd after the Feaſt of</hi> Pentecoſt; <hi>then it ſeems they
are agreed, for all is one day; wherefore this matter cannot determine one way
or the other by your Record, who are the Clerk,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And now we can
give no other credit to what is ſaid, but that the Bill was deliver'd the
firſt day of the Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. Forteſcue, <hi>This is an Act of
Parliament, and we will be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed before we make void any Act of
Parliament, and peradventure the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought to reſt till the next

and utterly unlawful, contrary to the Sheriffs Oath, and for which he ought to
be puniſh'd in One Hundred Pounds to the King, and Impriſonment one Year
without Bail; and One Hundred Pounds more to the Knight injured thereby, or to
any other Perſon who in his default will Sue for the ſame, and is contrary
to the two ſaid ſtanding Acts of Parliament, of greater conſequence than
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the Petition of Right themſelves, for if there is a
Proteſtant Parliament, no doubt they will make, and we ſhall not want
Proteſtant Laws, but if once there get in a Papiſt Parliament, both
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Laws, Religion, and Proteſtants themſelves, will be all
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And as the Sheriff Returns Fictions to Courts, ſo do they
ſend Fictions to him, and it is hard for him to know when they ſpeak true,
and when falſe; as, if a <hi>Venire Facias</hi> be ſent him, to Return 12
Jurors, he muſt Return 24, which is double the number, or he ſhall be
Fined, for as they write their words in the <hi>Venire</hi> by halves, ſo do
they (as it ſeems) their Meaning by halves, yet the poor Sheriff is bound to
underſtand them to his Coſt; then if they ſend him a <hi>Pone per Vadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
&amp; Salvos plegios,</hi> the Sheriff muſt Return no other <hi>Plegii</hi>
to anſwer their Fiction, than his own Fiction of <hi>Plegii, John Den</hi>
and <hi>Richard Fen,</hi> or they will teach the Party to have a falſe
Impriſonment againſt him. Suits are removed when the Plaintiff hath been at

                     </abbr> and this is ſo uſual, that 'tis
commonly ſaid, I'le beſtow a Bill of <hi>Middleſex</hi> on ſuch a man
to ſtay him in Town, that I may have his company into the Countrey when I go
down. And I my ſelf was informed by a Sea-Captain, who was a Sufferer in
ſuch an Arreſt, That there happen'd to be two Merchants in <hi>London,</hi>
each of which deſigned a Voyage to the ſame Port of <hi>Barbary,</hi>
whether he who could arrive firſt, was aſſured he ſhould to his great
gain obtain the Prime of the Market, to which purpoſe they both ſtrove with
all diligence poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which ſhould be foremoſt at the Spring, and it
happen'd that he who had his Ship firſt ready had entertained this Captain of
my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to command her for him, and all being ready to ſet Sail, the
Captain would needs walk into the City to take his parting Cup and Farewell of
his Friends, where unexpectedly he was Arreſted for 5000
<abbr>
                        <hi>l.</hi>
                     </abbr> though not owing a farthing, and the ſame being a
Choak-Bail-Sum, he knew he ſhould get none to be Surety for him, and
thereupon ſent to his Merchant, to inform him how he was boarded before he
could get aboard, who being much troubled that his Captain was taken by a Land
Pyrat, repaired to him, and underſtanding from him that he did not owe the
Party at whoſe Suit he was Arreſted a farthing, and knowing withal that it
was done by the Spite of the other Merchant to ſtop his Ship from getting
before him, he gave Bail for his Captain; and ſent him immediately on the
Voiage. All which Miſchiefs happen, becauſe there is no Law to compel to
give a Copy of the Declaration and Oath of Calumny before Arreſt, by which
all Fictions are prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All the Judicial Tranſactions of Fines and
Recoveries, are Fictions;<note place="margin">Fictions of Fines and
Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> ſo though we have fled from Land to Sea, and back again
from Sea to Land, we know not where to find Reſt for the Sole of our Foot
from Fictions. We are next come to another horrible cauſe of their
Increaſe, which is, that no Averment or Probation to the contrary is admitted
againſt the Sheriff or the Clerk, nor the Returns or Records; how Records,
which are nothing but the Scribling of Clerks in falſe <hi>Latine</hi> and
Court-hand, for their Fees, come to be of higher Authority than the Scripture
it ſelf, is ſtrange; for it was never denied, except againſt <hi>Mahomets
Alchoran,</hi> but Averment and contrary Probation might be brought againſt
the falſe Copying, falſe Tranſlating, or falſe Printing of any word, or
Clauſe in the Scripture, or it would be very difficult to overthrow Popery.
What greater reaſon is there of ſo many For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of Clerks, but that
there is no Averment allowed againſt their <pb n="304" facs="tcp:49347:165"/>Records, nor
contrary Probation, whereby they may for Money inſert what Fictions and
Falſities they pleaſe. <hi>Eſtopples</hi> are another miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
cauſe, and the denial of liberty of <hi>Travers</hi> as bad or worſe than
the other.</p>

                  <p>I am weary and aſhamed to recite ſo much, reflecting ſo

                     <head>A Diſpute between two Judges, concerning Formality and
Truth in Judicial Proceeding.</head>
                     <p>The point of Formality in Judicial Proceedings is very well
Diſputed by two famous Judges, <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> and <hi>Brook,</hi> 14.
<hi>H.</hi> 8.25. <hi>b.</hi> Where the Caſe was this, In an Action of Debt
brought on an Obligation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſed <pb n="307" facs="tcp:49347:166"/>with a Condition, to
perform all Covenants in an Indenture, between the Defendant and Plaintiff,
which Indenture contained Four Covenants, One whereof was, That a ſtranger
ſhould be Clerk to the Sheriff, who was then Plaintiff; and alſo that the
ſtranger ſhould pay at the Profers Seventeen Pounds at ſuch a Feaſt,
and Thirty Pounds more at ſuch a Feaſt, and other Covenants which he
Recites; and ſaith further, That he was a Lay-man, and not Letter'd, and that
the Indenture was read to him, concerning no more than the two firſt
Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and no other, which two he had paid and performed, and ſo damands
Judgment <hi>Si Actio,</hi> and ſays not <hi>Et ſic non eſt factum,</hi>
on which Plea the Sergeants demur'd in Law. <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> I conceive
this a good Plea, for by the Law a man is Compellable to no more than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to
ſhew the matter of his Caſe in Truth and good Sentence, and if the Parties
in their ſhewing cannot agree, then to join Iſſue upon the matter of Fact
on which they differ, and put it on Trial of the Jury, and then the Judg, on
the Truth of the matter of Fact found, ſhall adjudg what is the Law; and here
it ſeems the Defendant hath ſhewn in Truth and good Sentence, for he hath
ſhewn he was a Lay-man and not Letter'd; and that only two of the Covenants
in the Indenture were read unto him, and no more; and I think he is only bound
to perform what was read to him, and ſo the Obligation to be good for the
ſame, and void for the Reſidue which was not read; and I find it adjudged,
47. <hi>E.</hi> 3. where one was bound to an ignorant Lay-man, who was not
Letter'd in an Hundred Pounds to be paid at ſeveral days of payment; and at
the firſt day the Obligor made due payment for what was then to be paid, and
the Obligee made him an Acquittance of the firſt Sum, and in the end of the
Acquittance was added a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Releaſe; and of this, only that part was
read to the Obligee which was an Acquittance of the firſt Sum, but the part
which mention'd a general Releaſe was not read; and this matter was pleaded
in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Debt after brought againſt the Obligor, and it made the
Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which was read good, and the Releaſe which was not read void,
and ſo the Deed was adjudged good for part, and void for part; and it would
be a great Miſchief if it ſhould be otherwiſe, for in the ſame Caſe,
if the Deed ſhould be void in whole, then the Obligor ſhould loſe all the
Money he paid, and if it ſhould be good in the whole, then the Obligee
ſhould loſe his Obligation, which were unreaſonable that any man ſhould
be deceived by his Ignorance of the Fact, though he may by his Ignorance of the
Law. And here the Defendant being bound to perform two of the Conditions in the
Indenture, which were read to him, he cannot plead <hi>non eſt factum,</hi>
for that would be a <pb n="308" facs="tcp:49347:167"/>Lie, and contrary to the Truth, of
his own confeſſion; therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath pleaded the Truth in good
Order and good Sentence, and concludes Judgment, <hi>Si Actio,</hi> I think he
cannot plead or conclude in any better Form. And <hi>Brudnell</hi> agreed with
<hi>Fitzheabert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brook,</hi> Ch. Juſtice. I conceive the contrary, and
that the concluſion is not good. And Sir, as to what is ſaid, that the Law
is no other, but that a man ſhall Declare his matter in Truth and good
Sentence; the Law is more than ſo, for without Formality the ſame is
nothing worth; as the Form of Law is, a man ſhall ſhew his matter without
Duplicity of Multiplicity, yet may matters more than one be True and in good
Sentence, but they want Formality, and therefore are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, and a Form
ought to be uſed, or otherwiſe all things will be in confuſion. So in
Treſpaſs, the Defendant ought to give a colour of Right to the Plaintiff,
yet the colour is not true, nor the Sentence the better, but it is the
Formality which is required; and Formality is the chiefeſt thing in our Law,
and though the matter in the preſent Plea appears in Truth and good Sentence,
yet here wants For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, for he ought here to have concluded not Judgment
<hi>Si Actio,</hi> but <hi>Sic non eſt facium,</hi> for I conceive, in regard
only two Convenants of the Indenture were read to him, and there were more
Covenants not read, that the whole Indenture is void, and it is Fraud in the
Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligee. And <hi>Pollard</hi> agreed with <hi>Brook</hi> that it was no good
Plea, and that the whole Indenture was void. But to this <hi>Fitzherbert</hi>
and <hi>Brud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi> might have repli'd, that admit the whole Indenture had
been all void in Law for the Fraud in part, and the Defendant might <hi>Rigore
Juris</hi> Plead it, yet <hi>Quilibet poteſt Renunciare juri pro ſe
introducio,</hi> if the Defendant was more merciful than the Law, and his
Conſcience would not ſuffer him to uſe <hi>Summum jus,</hi> but doth
aſſent to perform thoſe Covenants were read to him; is it therefore
Reaſon or Conſcience that the Plaintiff for his good Nature and
Courteſie, ſhould return him Evil for Good, and put the Burden of all the
Covenants on him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would perform any when he needed perform none,
if he would have pleaded in a Form againſt his Conſcience, and that Truth
ought to be prefer'd before Fiction and Formality? But I leave the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of
the Cauſe to others to Cenſure, and ſhall only upon the whole Diſpute,

Obſervations,</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) It appears by the Caſe, that there are but Four
Judges in the Court, and they are divided Two againſt Two,
<hi>Fitzherbert</hi> and <hi>Brud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi> for Truth againſt Fiction, and
Subſtance againſt Formality; and <hi>Block</hi> and <hi>Pel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ard</hi> for Fiction againſt
Truth, and Formality againſt Subſtance, whence is ſhown, that there have
been, and are many <pb n="309" facs="tcp:49347:167"/>good men Judges, and other
Profeſſors of the Law, who with all their their Power, Deſire, and long
to remove thoſe Abuſes of Fictions, Forms, and other Irregularities, which
are Reproaches on the Practicers; but ſhould they afflict themſelves to
death, can do nothing, if equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſed or overpoiſed by the other Party,
therefore they ought not to be imputed to thoſe who are not guilty, but the
conſideration of them ought to be left to the Legiſlative, which hath Power
to Redreſs them when they pleaſe with a word, and ſhall give account to
God if they neglect the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) It may be obſerved how many Contentions ariſe
about a pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty piece of Formality, when there is none about the Subſtance;
which is acknowledged by <hi>Coke</hi> himſelf, <hi>Com. Lit.</hi> 303.
whoſe words are theſe: When I diligently conſider the Courſe of our
Books of Years and Terms, from the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Ed.</hi> the
<hi>Third,</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that more Jangling and Queſtions ariſe upon
the manner of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Exceptions to Form, than upon the matter it ſelf,
and infinite Cauſes loſt or delayed for want of good Pleading; by which he
means, Formality hath deſtroyed infinite good Cauſes, which is a moſt
horrible thing to be Tolerated in any Government.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) The next thing obſerveable is, The great
Ignorance of Cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s
themſelves, in their own Formalities, for they have continued by
<hi>Coke's</hi> confeſſion, Jangling and Wrangling about them ever ſince
<hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>Thirds</hi> time, and are yet never the wiſer, nor
any perfect Form invented or ſettled by them; they are ſtill ever Learning
and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the knowledg of Truth, and ſo will be to Dooms-day, if
they are not by God ſooner called to Account of their Stewardſhips, and
this point of Ignorance in their own Formalities, is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by
<hi>Coke</hi> in another place, where he ſaith, It were to be wiſhed, that
<hi>Littleton</hi> had writ ſomething concerning Pleadings, which ſhews, he
was but a wiſher or woulder at it himſelf, for whom, if he had been able,
it had been far more proper to have writ a perfect Form of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Proceeding, than to wiſh the ſame had been done by one dead Hundreds of
Years before, and if he could have had him alive, 'tis likely he was as much to
ſeck as himſelf; for he could not write any directions concerning it to his
own Son, though it was a point above all other which he deſired he might
Learn; and in reſpect of which, his <hi>Tenures</hi> were but Trifles, but he
is fain to leave it to him as his other Quaeries <hi>de Dubiis,</hi> and a
<hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> where he ſhould g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

on it; in theſe words: And know my Son, that it is one of the moſt
Honourable, Laudable, and Profitable things in our Law, to have the Science of
well Pleading <pb n="310" facs="tcp:49347:168"/>in Actions Real and Perſonal, and
therefore I counſel thee eſpecially to employ thy Courage and Care to learn
this. Which yet neither he nor any ſince ever learnt or found out in this
Climate, neither is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any to do, unleſs thoſe very Forms

of our Judicial Proceeding ſtands, it uſeth to give Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſometimes
Thirty Dilations, and thoſe on meer Toys, and not only for Probation by
Witneſſes, but to Except, Duply, Triply, Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As
likewiſe when the Diſputations are concluded, a Judg will delay Three,
Four, or more Years, before he will pronounce Sentence; neither do thoſe who
are ſet to preſide in Judicial Proceeding ſee ſo groſs 
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49347:168"/>Errors, and though they do, yet had they rather defend
than amend them. I fear therefore leſt the Lawyers come to the ſame end
which the Popiſh Judges and Clerks, their Predeceſſors in their Courts
did. It is certain the Soldiers in the late Troubles were ſo much enraged,
that they would have cut all their Fictions and Formalities to pieces, if any
would have preſcribed them a Form of Proceeding which ſhould be
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to them. Now all theſe Delays riſe from Diſputes or
pretence of cauſe of them, and all Diſputes at Common Law, riſe from
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities; and how can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing the Writs on which all
Judicial Proceedings are founded are nothing but Formalities? and all Demurs
and Diſputes relate only to the Giſt of the Writ, or the Form of the
Declaration or Plea which are Relative to the Writ, and there can be never any
Demurrer or Diſpute at Common Law on the Writ of the Merits of the Cauſe,
which though one Form of Writ will not bear, another may, and all Equity on
which the true merit of all Cauſes depends, is clean Excluded out of all
Common Law Courts, becauſe to Judg by Formalities is more profitable, and
raiſes more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions than the Merit or Equity of the Cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) It is to be Obſerved, how contradictory theſe
Formalities are to themſelves, and one another, as in the Caſe of Colour
before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, a meer unintelligible piece of Non-Senſe (for what is more
inſenſible than a Lie or Fiction) yet will they force the Defendant to this
Lie, and not to plead the General Iſſue of <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> not allow
him to plead a Special Iſſue according to his Caſe, as a Formality
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they take the Cauſe from the Jury to themſelves at their Arbitrary
pleaſure, ſo as unintelligibly and Arbitrarily, in all other Caſes, they
compell poor men to take or leave the General Iſſue at their Fancy, for
Formalities ſo uncertain, as they themſelves often contradict themſelves,
and ſometimes they are all divided, what Plea ſhall amount to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Iſſue, and what not, or what ought to be given in Evidence on the General
Iſſue, or what ought to be pleaded ſpecially, and not given in Evidence

which God hath given to that end, prompts them according to the ſame, and

Cauſes might continue perpetually to be loſt in it for the gain of
Practicers pleading to Juries, before whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of Fact, they ought

Chancellour, in deſiance of Three Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without any Sureties,
without any Oath of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, without any Judgment of Peers, publiſheth in
ſight of the Sun his abominable Orders, to caſt into Priſon the moſt
Innocent Perſon on the falſe Affidavit of every Perjur'd Knight of the
Poſt, yea a ſingle Affidavit, as appears by the Orders of the Chancellour
and Maſter of the Rolls, Printed 1669. <hi>Page</hi> 67. and yet they pretend
<hi>Page</hi> 65. under the Title of Commitment, that they are tender of the
Liberty of mens Perſons, and of their Impriſonments on Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits, and
confeſs they are often Malitious, and made by one mean and ignorant Perſon;
yet in the ſame breath, <hi>Page</hi> 67. as if they ſoon forgot, or
underſtood not what they ſaid, in the beginning of their Order, they, the
next leaf conclude, That a ſingle Affidavit of ſuch a malitious, mean, and
ignorant Perſon, yea though he is proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be Perjured, ſhall
be ſufficient to Impriſon the Innocent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and when he again gets out
of Gaol, if he can let the Innocent <pb n="320" facs="tcp:49347:173"/>Party be indamaged
his whole Eſtate, he ſhall not have a Farthing Coſt for the falſe
Impriſonment; and obſerve the depth of the Reaſon why, given by a
Chancellour, and (as the Printed Orders ſay) with advice and aſſiſtance
of the Maſter of the Bolls. 'tis this, as appears <hi>Page</hi> 68. at the
top of the leaf, <hi>viz.</hi> IN RESPECT OF THE OATH MADE AGAINST HIM AS
AFORESAID, that is to ſay, the Oath, though falſe, of a Villain Perjured,
againſt the Innocent Perſon; for ſo is the implication of the Order, and
likewiſe, though they durſt not ſay ſo in expreſs terms, yet ſo is
the implicit <hi>Non Obſtante,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any Law of God or Man,
or Acts of Parliament to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Doth not here a Chancellour aſſume
the Omnipotent Power of the Pope, to diſpenſe with the Laws of God and Men,
and aſſume a Power of Impriſoning the Subjects above the King and
Parliament, yea contrary, and in contempt of their Laws? he doth; for the Law
of God and Precept of Chriſt is known to prohibit the Impriſonment of
any,<note place="margin">No Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment ought to be, but where the
Witneſſes and Party are brought Face to Face.</note> without two
Witneſſes at leaſt, and without bringing the Witneſſes and the Party
accuſed face to face, that he may know them, and except againſt their
Perſons or Teſtimony if he hath cauſe, which is never done on an
Affidavit. And the Laws of the Land, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and Petition of
Right, utterly prohibit all Impriſonment of the Subject on Affidavits,
whether they are true or falſe, without bringing the Witneſſes and the
Party face to face, and a Judgment on ſuch Teſtimony againſt him by his
Peers; and if ſuch Evil Precedents be ſuffer'd to paſs without ſome
example of Juſtice ſhewn on them, all Acts of Parliament which ever have
been or ſhall be for protection of the Liberty of the Subject,<note place="margin">Forgery Licenſed in <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> thereby to Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Chancellour in the ſaid <hi>Chancery</hi>-Orders, Printed 1669. preſumes to
do in the Court of Conſcience, what was never heard of to be done in the
Courts of <hi>Turks,</hi> Infidels, or the moſt Barbarous Judicatories in the
World; for he is not aſhamed publickly to give Licenſe to Curſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and
their Clerks to commit <hi>Crimen Falſi,</hi> which we call Forgery, by
Antedating Writs, taking them out of Returns paſt, or of a former Term; by
reaſon of which Forgery of Writs, and Forgery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, Antedated
<hi>Capiaſes,</hi> Proclamations, Exigends, and Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Antedated have
been likewiſe Forged, and Thouſands of Poor men unjuſtly caſt in Goals,
and miſerably undone, without any Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or Hearing; and theſe are
likewiſe the damnable effects of the Chancellours Writs, by which, as by
others, the Plaintiffs, ſo here the Defendants, are deſtroyed without
Hearing; and certainly theſe Crimes of Antedating and Forgery of Judicial
Acts, though here Licenſed by Orders of Chancellors, and Protected by Courts,
by not Licenſing <pb n="321" facs="tcp:49347:173"/>Averments againſt them, are by the
Civil Law, and Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of many other Nations, both of
theſe, and Inſtruments, Death; and even by our own, the imbeſelling of a
Record by a Clerk, and Counterfeiting of Fines, is Felony; and, if the ſecond
time, ſo is the Forgery of Deeds. Writings, and Court-Rolls; and
deſervedly, the Offender better deſerving death than a Robber on a
High-way; and why any Crimes of this Nature ſhould be publickly Licenſed to
the Ruin of all Truth and Juſtice, by any Chancellour in his
<hi>Chancery</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is very ſtrange; the miſchievous effects of
which ſaid Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Affidavit, and Antedating Writs, and Forgery of
Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are notoriouſly known, and not complained of here without good
Cauſe and Teſtimony; and ſome particular experience of my own, to my
loſs, who have (as well as others) ſuffer'd in an high degree by the

a Judg out of the Province or County where the Defendant lived, for it was a
great vexation and oppreſſion of the People to be Summon'd out of the
Provinces on malitious Suggeſtions, without cauſe; and our own Parliaments
in <hi>England</hi> have often complained againſt the ſame oppreſſion
here by the Pope, on whoſe Citations and falſe Suggeſtions without
cauſe, men were compell'd to give perſonal Appearances at <hi>Rome,</hi> as
many and as often as he pleaſed, if any would but buy there of his Officers a
Citation; and to prevent this vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious exaction of Appearances on Writs, of
men out of their own Counties, beſides the requiring of Pledges on all Common
Law Writs, and the enjoining of Pledges to be taken in the
<hi>Chancery</hi>-Writ of <hi>Subpoena,</hi> as in the <hi>Lex Julia,</hi> ſo
is it mention'd in <hi>Magna Charta, Nulli vendentus nulli negabimus

other Writs, whereby Right is obtained; for if the Chancellour were not to take
Fees, and ſell his <hi>Subpoena's</hi> and other Writs, he would not ſo
often by them make men Travail thorough Nine Shires to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
(when they may have better Juſtice done at home in their own County) on no
other cauſe than Fictitious and Malitious Suggeſtions of the Plaintiff, and
that he may take a Fee for the ſame, and he would Cancel according to his
Office more Petitions and Bills than he would Grant; but aſſoon as
Chancellours took Fees for Writs (which Sale of Right, 'tis likely, as
<hi>Polydore</hi> ſays, came from the <hi>French</hi>) then no Suit could be
begun without Writ, all were driven to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> Parties,

                     <p n="13">(13.) The old Writs which are in the Regiſter, and
all the new which have been coined or joined by Chancellours or Clerks, are
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and inſufficient to ſupply Juſtice in the multitude of Caſes

                     <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe the greateſt part of the Writs of the

                     <p n="2">(2.) All real Actions are thrown aſide; and the
truth is, Lawyers are ſo ignorant how to manage them, that, like the old

Patent,</hi> and <hi>Novel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin,</hi> the one to determine the
Right, the other the Poſſeſſion; no Lawyer now knows in them to join
the <hi>Miſe,</hi> or arraign the Aſſiſe, any more than he doth when he
talks of <hi>Robin Hood</hi> to Shoot in his Bow, whereby the two chief Writs,
which diſpatcht more Juſtice than all the reſt, are utterly loſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) It is as impoſſible for a Chancellour and
Clerk, though they make in their <hi>Officina Brevium</hi> a Thouſand Forms
of Writs more than they have, to fit with them all that want Right, any more
than for a <hi>Shoe-maker</hi> in his <hi>Officina Calceorum,</hi> though he
hath a good ſtock of Shoes ready made, to all the Feet with them which want
Shoes; yea more impoſſible; for the Shoe-maker makes his Shoes of ſoft
yielding Leather, his Straps or Buckles open or ſhut them wider or cloſer,
his Shoeing-horn, Weeſel-skin or Fiſts, draw, pull, and thump them off and
on, and many pretty tricks and Inſtruments he hath to curry, ſhave,
ſtretch, punch, oil, water, and ſtand them on the Laſt, to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
them for the Foot, but a Chancellour makes all his Writs of <hi>Iron</hi> or

                     <p n="5">(5.) That there is an intolerable defect in Writs to
ſupply Juſtice to the People, appears in this, That though all Originals

                        </gap>itles it ſelf a Court of Conſcience and Equity, yet there is
not one Writ to Remedy a particular Caſe of either, nor any Action on the
Caſe, for a Caſe of Conſcience or Equity ariſing from the Moral Law of
God, but all fall down and worſhip the Themis or Great Idol of the Ceremonial
Law of Man, of Livery and Seiſin, <pb n="328" facs="tcp:49347:177"/>Fines, Recoveries,
Inrollments, Writings, Seals, Forms of Entries, Forms of Pleading, Forms of
Words, Fictions, and the like, which are not able to give a Right to the
leaſt foot of Land or handful of Goods, nor any other Law than the Moral Law
of God of Truth and Equity; neither if theſe Writs were Formed according to
the Truth and Equity of the Moral Law of God, is it poſſible a ſufficient
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould be Formed, for Writs are finite, and Caſes of Equity
infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and not to be put in Writs, or written, except by God, in the
Fleſhly Tables of the Heart, and in the Spiritual Tables of the Soul it
ſelf, and Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>It will be asked, How could they ſubſiſt before
<hi>H.</hi> 6. without a <hi>Sub paena</hi> and Equity from a Chancellour,
ſeeing the Common Law Writs could not ſupply it; and what expedient is
there now how Equity may be ſupplied? To which I anſwer, That Equity was
then ſupplied by the Writ of Right, and <hi>Juſticies,</hi> the Titles of
both which Writs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Equity; and likewiſe other Writs, and the
General Iſſues Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, of the <hi>Meer Right, Not Guilty, Null
Tort, Null diſſerſint, Nihil debet,</hi> guided the Jury to find
according to Right and Equity, by the Moral Law of God, and not the Ceremonial
Law of Man; till the Judges, to wreſt the Power belonging to Jurors into
their own hands, brought in the Tender of the Demy mark, to turn the Iſſue
of meer Right into a Poſſeſſary Iſſue, and inſtead of Truth
brought in the Pictions of Colours, deſtroyed the <hi>Juſticies</hi> by
<hi>Writs of Remover,</hi> gave way to falſe Laying of Counties in
Tranſitory Actions, changed <hi>Venues,</hi> granted new Trials, abated
Declarations for Variance from the Bond, and not Sueing for what was paid, as
well as for what was not, granting Arreſts of Judgment after Verdict, and not
permitting to demur firſt to the Law, and after to plead to the Fact before
Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, prohibited on the Iſſue <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> matters of
Juſtification to be given in Evidence, admitted Demurs to Evidence, admitted
ſpecial Verdicts, cauſed Juries to be of an even and not of an odd number,
and the Verdict not to be according to the Plurality of Votes; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other
ways they had to weary Juries from giving a Verdict accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Conſcience
and Equity, or when they had ſo given it, to ſame.</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, to compell men to Commence Suites by
Writs in the preſent Age, is to condemn them without Hearing of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Merits of their Cauſe; and to compell them to revive again thoſe
Ancient Writs, and trie Equity by Juries, hath many great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences,
before mention'd to be incident to all Writs, eſpecially ſuch as are
Antiquated and not underſtood; but all theſe miſchiefs are 
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49347:177"/>ſalved by Commencing Suites by a Copy of the
Declaration Sworn, in ſtead of a Writ, which cannot be Sworn, and a Judg
Commiſſionated with Juriſdiction of Fact, Law, and Equity, under Appeal,
which ſingle Judg in a Court by himſelf ſitting without Vacation, as a
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour hath Power to do, will, no doubt, be able to diſpatch more
Cauſes without troubling any Writs, Juries, or Councel at the Bar, and more
juſtly and under Account in one Year, then 'tis poſſible for any
Chancellour with Plurality of Offices, or Court with Plurality of Judges,
Juries, and Councel at the Bar, to do in Seven.</p>

whereby the Enemy commonly obtained his Deſign of Stopping the Raiſing new

of Kings in perſon, as the Electors are in Power, is better than none at all,
and better than a Confederacy of Kings by Proxies, they remaining in their
ſeveral Palaces; yet in many other reſpects the Union being of the Prelates
and Princes, and not of an equal Repreſentative of the People, it is liable
to perpetual dangers of Civil Wars, and the Dividing of one Prince againſt
another, who may perhaps, as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and

invincible, for the Prince were then but one, and the Senate but one; but this
is impoſſible to be performed, except in Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, for then
muſt the Pope and Prelates be Caſhier'd, which no Catholick Prince can, or
dare attempt. How great thanks do we therefore owe to God, who hath

not ſo great a Mercy, as perhaps may not again be ſo eaſily offer'd? The

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereas thou</hi> N. <hi>haſt been by ſufficient proof

remaineſt obſtinate, without any Evidence or Sign of true Repentance;
Therefore in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and before this

ſhut out from the Communion of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Denunciation of this Sentence, the People are to be
warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they hold him to be caſt out of the Communion of the

nevertheleſs Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication diſſolves not the Bonds of Civil or Natural
Relations, nor exempteth from the Duties belonging to them.</p>
                  <p>If the Party after Excommunication ſhew Signs of Repentance,
then the Form of Abſolution is appointed to be this, or the like,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereas thou</hi> N. <hi>haſt for thy Sin been ſhut

                  <p>The old Epiſcopal Forms of Evcommunication being ſo
groſs, as if publiſh'd, not able to clear off the Charge of Exceptions in
that furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time of Conteſt made againſt them, the Anti-Power in the
Forms before mention'd, ſcrewed their Wits to the higheſt, that they might
ſo refine them, as if poſſible, no Exception might be took againſt
them; for it matter'd not how the Form was, ſo they might obtain the effect
of commanding the Temporal Sword by the <hi>Excommunicato capiendo,</hi> and
continue to poſſeſs thereby the great Power and Profits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which
have been before mention'd, to belong to Marriage, and all other points of
Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; yet there is always ſuch a Repugnancy in
the mixture of Truth and Falſity, that never ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially gilded over,
the Flaws of the one will be viſible and lie open to Exception from the
Solidity of the other. Againſt theſe Forms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well as the
former, may be the following Exceptions taken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is excepted againſt the Form of Excommunication,
That it is in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, without ſhewing a Sign of
Miſſion from Jeſus Chriſt; for <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14. It is ſaid,
<hi>The Prophets propheſie Lies in my Name; I ſent him not, neither have I
commanded them, neither ſpake unto them.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.15. <hi>I
have not ſent them, ſaith the Lord, yet they Propheſie a Lie in my Name,
that I might drive you out, and that he might periſh, ye, and the Prophets
that propheſie unto you.</hi> And 29.9. <hi>For they Propheſie falſely
unto you in my Name; I have not ſent them ſaith the Lord.</hi> So may a
Prieſt of <hi>Baal,</hi> or a Papiſt Prieſt ſay, he Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates in
the name of the Lord, or in the name of Jeſus. Chriſt, as well as a
Presbyter, if he be not put to his Sign of Miſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is a Civil or Temporal puniſhment of
Excommunication or Baniſhment from Society, Sentenced or adjudged by this
Form, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Commiſſion ſhewn from the Magiſtrate or Tempor

Judg, then every man would Judg in his own Caſe; which would be a
confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Government.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Form Excommunicates from Communion with the
Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and declares not who are the Faithful, or how they may be known.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Form Excommunicates from the Church, but doth
not ſay whether a Particular Church or the Catholick Church, or a National,
or a Parochial Church, or Congregational Church; and being only Formed to be
Pronounced by the Rector of a Parochial or Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church, it is as
improper to extend his Spiritual Juriſdiction to a National Church, as the
Temporal Authority of a Petty Conſtable to a Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Form Excluding from Communion, declares not whether from
Spiritual or Temporal Communion, or both; if Spiritual, it declares not whether
from the Word Preached, or Prayer, or Sacrament; if from either, or all, the
Interdiction of a Carnal man from Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is no Puniſhment, but
he will rather rejoice in it than Repent, and had rather take the pleaſures
of Earth than of Heaven; if it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend from Temporal Communion, then the
Spiritual Perſon exceeds his Bounds to Judg of things Temporal; and
beſides, the Comment deſtroys the Teut; for it declares, That
Excommunication diſſolves not the Bonds of Civil or Natural Relations: Now
all Temporal things are under Bonds of Civil or Natural Relations, therefore it
cannot intend Excluding from Communion in Temporal Things; but indeed it is
ſuch a Linſie-Woolſie of Spiritual and Temporal, that neither it ſelf
nor any other knows what it intends; and ſuch an <hi>Amphibion</hi> of
Fleſh and Spirit, none knows in what Element to place it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication a word
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</note>Excluding from Communion, or Excommunication, is a word
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible; the old <hi>Pagans</hi> Interdiction from Fire and Water, the
<hi>Druydes</hi> Interdiction from the Sacrifices, the great and leſſer
Curſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Phariſees caſting out of the Synagogue,
the delivery by <hi>Paul</hi> to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, were all Words Senſible and
Intelligible; but Excommunication is a Word without Senſe, Signification or
Intelligence; no Wonder therefore if there is not ſuch a word in the whole
Scripture, not that men could never draw the Form of a <hi>Chimaera</hi>
without incongruity, which hath no Being in Nature, but in the vertiginous
Notions of a Phrenzy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſame Ordinance of the long Parliament, in the
Prayer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be uſed with this Form of Excommunication, calls it the
Ordinance of God; which is the ſame which is before-mention'd, 
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:49347:189"/>
                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14.14. <hi>The Prophets propheſie Lies
in my Name, I ſent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither ſpake I
unto them.</hi> How can that be an Ordinance of God or Chriſt, which they
never ſo much as ſpake, nor is the word to be found in the whole
Scripture?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This Form brings in Popiſh Confeſſion of Sins
to the Prieſt, and Penance, and Commutation-Money, and Puniſhment of one
Sin Twice, firſt by the Magiſtrate, and then by the Prieſt.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ricant,</hi> amongſt many other his rare
Obſervations, Relates, <hi>page</hi> 277. That the <hi>Greek</hi>
Chriſtians believe, If any Perſon die Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by the Biſhop, and
not Abſolved, ſome Evil Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the Body in the Grave, which
Actuates and preſerves him from Corruption, in the ſame manner as the Soul
informs and animates a living Body; and that they feed in the Night, walk,
digeſt, and are nouriſhed, and have been found Ruddy in complexion, and
their Veins after Forty days Burial, extended with Blood, and when open'd with
a Launcet, have yeilded Blood as plentiful, freſh and quick, as that which
iſſues from young and Sanguine Perſons; And it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him by a
<hi>Candiot Caloire</hi> call'd <hi>Sophronio,</hi> a Preacher in
<hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of great Repute and Learning, That a certain Perſon for
ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours committed in the <hi>Morea,</hi> fled to the Iſle of
<hi>Milo,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Excommunicated died: In the mean time the Relations
of the Deceaſed were much afflicted and Anxious for the ſad Eſtate of
their Dear Friend, whilſt the Peaſants and Iſlanders were every Night
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted and diſturbed with ſtrange and unuſual Apparitions, which 
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49347:189"/>they immediately concluded aroſe from the Grave of the
accurſed Excommunicate; which according to their Cuſtom they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
open'd, and therein found the Body uncorrupted, Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Veins replete
with Blood, the Coſtin was furniſhed with Grapes, Apple, and Nuts, and
ſuch Fruit as the Seaſon afforded: whereupon Conſultation being made, the
<hi>Caloires</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make Uſe of the common Remedy in thoſe
Caſes, which was, to Cut and Diſmember the Body into ſeveral Parts, and
to boil it in Wine, as the approved means to diſlodg the Evil Spirit, and
diſpoſe the Body to a diſſolution. But the Friends of the Deceaſed
being willing and deſirous that the Corps ſhould reſt in Peace, and
ſome eaſe given to the Departed Soul, obtained a Reprieve from the Clergy,
and hopes that for a Sum of Money (they being Perſons of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Eſtate) a Releaſe might be purchaſed of this Excommunication under the
hand of the Patriarch; in this manner the Corps were for a while freed from
diſſection, and Letters thereupon ſent to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
with this Direction, That in caſe the Patriarch ſhould condeſcend to take
off the Excommunication, that the Day, Hour and Minute that he Signed the
Pardon, ſhould be inſerted in the Date. And now the Corps were taken into
the Church (the Countrey People not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing they ſhould remain the
Field) and Prayers and Maſſes daily ſaid for its Diſſolution, and
Pardon of the Offender; when one Day, after many Prayers, Supplications and
Offerings, (as this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronio</hi> atteſted with many Proteſtations)
and whilſt he himſelf was performing Divine Service, on a ſudden was
heard a rumbling noiſe in the Coſſin of the Dead Party, to the Fear and
Aſtoniſhment of all Perſons there preſent; which when they had open'd,
they found the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Conſumed and Diſſolved as far into its firſt
Principles of Earth, as if it had been Seven Years Buried: the Hour and Minute
of this Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was immediately Noted, and preciſely Obſerved,
which being compared with the Date of the Patriarch's Releaſe, when it was
Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it was found exactly to agree with the
Moment in which the Body returned to its Aſhes. And he after ſaith, Such is
the much-tobe-Lamented Poverty of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, that they are not
only forced to ſell Excommunications, but the very Sacraments; and to
expoſe the moſt Reverend and Myſterious Offices of Religion unto Sale for
the maintenance and Support of the Prieſt-hood. The ſame Author writing
concerning the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church, <hi>page</hi> 439. ſaith, That
Excommunication is as frequent amongſt them as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by the
Abuſe of which, the Prieſt procures the moſt conſiderable part of their
Gains; nor is any Eccleſiaſtical Right performed, nor a Benefice 
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:49347:190"/>confer'd without Money. And, <hi>p.</hi> 439. he ſaith,
That amongſt the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians,</hi> the Penance on which Excommunication or
Abſolution is to follow, being once impoſed by the Prieſt, no man can
Remit, no not the Biſhop or Patriarch himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Hence is to be Obſerved, That the only Final
Cauſes why the <hi>Greek, Armenian, Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Popes agree to Exerciſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, Penance and Abſolution, and to
ſet Heaven and Hell to Sale for Commutation-Money, are only Covetouſneſs
and Ambition; and thereby to Lord it more imperiouſly over the Conſciences,
Lives, Liberties and Propriety of their Superſtitious Adorers, than any
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Emperor is able to do over his Vaſſals.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That 'tis the Prelate only pockets all the Money in
the <hi>Greek, Romiſh, Ethiopian, Muſcovitiſh, Ruſſe</hi> and
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches, and ſtarves the inferior Clergy, and the
Parochial Prieſt in the <hi>Arminian;</hi> and that the Penance and
Excommunication of the Parochial Prieſts muſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be heavier, and his
Abſolution ſold dearer than the Pope's or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat's; becauſe the
remoteneſs of the one, and the greatneſs of his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, and that he
muſt thereby leave all to Under-Officers, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Act in Perſon,
cauſe his Inquiſitions not to be ſo ſtrict, but multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes will find
eaſie Evaſions from them; whereas the Parochial Prieſt having the narrow
Bounds of his Pariſh always under his Eye, and within his reach, will not
only ſwallow every Camel, but ſtrain at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gnat which comes within his
verge, for the advantage of his Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Dominion and Gains.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) That the <hi>Greek</hi> Popes are notwithſtanding
but Poor, and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Rich, becauſe the Grand <hi>Seignior</hi>
being not Superſtitious, nor his Empreſſes, nor fearing ſuch
counterfeit Fulminations as Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and his <hi>Mufti's</hi> or
Arch-Biſhops being only <hi>Durante Beneplaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and his
Pariſh-Prieſts Elected by the People without Conſecration or Ordination,
and Independent one of another; neither the <hi>Greek</hi> Popes, Patriarchs,
Biſhops nor Prieſts, nor his-own, dare Excommunicate him; whereas the
Chriſtian, both <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Emperors, their
Empreſſes, Children and People, having been permitted to be perpetually
Educated by the Popes in Blindneſs and Superſtition, he hath them, upon the
matter, in the condition of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> with
their Eyes pull'd out, and makes them grind for him as he pleaſes, or with
his Ecommunications ſends them packing (as they in their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance think) to
Hell or Purgatory, which makes moſt for his Gains and Profit, whereby he hath
accumulated infinite Riches.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) The Effects of Excommunication on the Bodies of
Dead men, is either Witchcraft, or a Cheat; Witchcraft is poſſible to be
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <pb n="355" facs="tcp:49347:190"/>not always, as may eaſily be proved from
the Raiſing of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> by the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and an
Hundred Hiſtories more related by Authors of unqueſtionable Credit. And as
the Devil may ſometimes be permitted to abuſe the Bodies of the beſt men
when Living, as he did <hi>Job's,</hi> and, what is the higheſt Example,
Chriſt himſelf, carrying him to the Pinacle of the Temple; ſo he may when
they are Dead. I ſhall Inſtance one only Example further in the Primitive
times, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Cornelius Agrippa de occult. Philoſ. lib.</hi> 3.
<hi>cap.</hi> 41. where he Relates out of the <hi>Cretenſian</hi> Hiſtory,
That certain Ghoſts, which they call'd <hi>Catechanae,</hi> were wont to
return back to their Bodies and go into their Wives and lie with them; for the
Avoiding of which, and that they might not annoy their Wives any more, it was
provided by their Common Law, That the Hearts of them who did Ariſe, ſhould
be thruſt through with an Awle, and their whole Carcaſſes be burnt to
Aſhes. Theſe without Doubt are wonderful things, and ſcarce credible; did
not thoſe Laws themſelves, and ancient Hiſtories witneſs them. The
frequent practice likewiſe of <hi>Necromancers,</hi> by their wicked Art to
call the Devil into a Dead Body, and take Reſponſes from him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what
hath been ſaid. And it may be likewiſe a Cheat; for it may be eaſie for
the Prieſts to put Apples, Grapes and Nuts in a Coffin, and by Night to make
fearful Noiſes, Shrieks, Groans, and Counterfeit Apparitions about Graves and
Tombs; whence the horror of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, and darkneſs, make ſuch
impreſſions on timorous Fancies, as they ſhall not dare to approach, much
leſs examine the matter, and take out the new Body out of the Coffin, and put
in one had been Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Seven Years, and then a Vault made of purpoſe to make
a noiſe under ground in the Church, and <hi>Sofronio</hi> know nothing of all
this.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) But whether it were Witchcraft or Cheat, it is
moſt horrible wickedneſs to make Uſe of either, under pretence of
Church-Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or the Worſhip of God, ſeeing they both come from the
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alvarez,</hi> a <hi>Portugal</hi> Prieſt, Relates of
himſelf, That at the Town of <hi>Barva</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> there
appeared a Terrible Cloud of an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Locuſts, which at length
fell and Devoured the Countrey; and that he and another <hi>Portuguez</hi>
Prieſt took a Conſecrated Stone, and the Croſs, and ſung the Letany,
and in this manner went in Proceſſion through the Corn-Fields for the
ſpace of a Mile unto a little Hill, and there he cauſed them to take a
quantity of the Locuſts, and made of them a Conjuration, which he carried
with him in writing, which he had made the Night before; Requiring them,
Charging them, and <pb n="356" facs="tcp:49347:191"/>Excommunicating them, Willing them
within Three Hours ſpace to begin to depart towards the Sea, or towards the
Land of <hi>Morez,</hi> or towards the Deſart Mountains, and to let the
Chriſtians alone; and if they obey'd him not, he called and adjured the Fowls
of the Air, the Beaſts of the Field, and all the Tempeſts to ſcatter,
deſtroy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Bodies: And for this purpoſe he took the
quantity of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts and made this Admonition to them that were preſent, in
the name of themſelves, and thoſe which were abſent, and ſo let them
go, and gave them liberty. The Locuſts began forthwith to depart, and in the
mean while a mighty Tempeſt and Thunder aroſe toward the Sea, which drowned
all the Locuſts in the River, and the dead Locuſts remained in heaps two
Fathom high on the Banks; ſo by the Morning there was not one Locuſt left
alive. This Excommunication, if true, were Conjuring and Witchcraft.</p>

                  <p>Excommunication gives the Pope the Legiſlative Power over
all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for by this he made his Canon-Law, whenſoever he pleaſed, to
be obſerved through Chriſtendom, by no other Obligation, than his Command
they ſhould be obſerved on pain of Excommunication. By granting the Power
of Excommunication, the Legiſlative Power is granted; and the Clergy in
Convocation uſed anciently, without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Royal Aſſent, to make
Canons touching matters of Religion, to bind not only themſelves, but all the
Laity, without Aſſent of the Lords and Commons in Parliament. It was uſed
in ancient time for Creditors, beſides other Security, to procure Debtors to
Swear they would pay them, and thereupon there being then no Arreſt in the
Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Courts for Debt, they Sued them in the Spiritual Courts on their
Oaths; and they granted an <hi>Excommunicato Capiendo</hi> to Arreſt them
without Bail; which were ſo frequent, that <hi>E.</hi> 1. could not keep his
Servants free from Arreſt in his Court, till, to prevent it, he cauſed a

Deprehended in any Robbery, Murder, Felony, Burning of Houſes, and the like,
ſhould be Tried and Adjudged in the Temporal Courts as Lay-men were. But
<hi>Becket</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſtood proudly on the
Pontificial Prerogative of the Clergy, That no Clergy-man ought to be Tried,
but in their own Spiritual Courts, and by men of their own Coat: And if they
were Convicted before them, they ought only to be deprived of their Office; but
if they after offended, they ſhould be Judged in the Kings Courts: This Power
of Judgment he drew to his own Court, only by his Power of Excommunication.</p>

ſent to the Pope for an Abſolution of his Oath. Which the Pope not only
granted, but incouraged him to perſiſt in the Courſe he had begun. The

Seiſes on his Temporalities, and withal Threatens a Proceeding againſt his
Perſon. <hi>Becket</hi> thereupon flies the Realm, and appeals to the Pope,

their Oath of Canonical Obedience to him, who was their Arch-Biſhop. The King

whither again arrived, he continued, notwithſtanding the favour of the Kings:
Reſtauration, as bad as before; in Proſecuting his Excommunications he had
got at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt ſuch Biſhops as ſided with the King; of
which when the Excommunicated Biſhops complained to the King, and moved
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his Paſſion, He cried out, <hi>Shall I never be quiet for this

other to Rid me of this trouble.</hi> Whereupon Four Knights ſtanding by,
took their Journey to find the Arch-Biſhop; whom they found at Church on the
ſteps; where they ſtrook him on the Head with their Swords, and killed him;
which though, in the manner of doing, it was no way Juſtifiable, being
without lawful Hearing and Trial: Yet 'tis very manifeſt, that the
Arch-Biſhop by the Common Law it ſelf, without the trouble of an Attainder

High-Treaſon: and he was manifeſtly Guilty; for it was, by the Common Law,

Sentences him both as Mute, and Contumaciouſly abſent, and ſeiſes on

Conſideration will be, how this might have been prevented by his Renowned
Father, who was of ſuch Wiſdome, Vigilance and Valour, as neither
<hi>Gaveſton</hi> nor <hi>Spencer</hi> nor Biſhops Dared to abuſe; if he
had ſuſpected they would have practiſed ſuch Treachery againſt the
younger yeares of his ſon. Concerning which, it ſeemes he was able and
might have eaſily prevented it, had he not Committed two overſights, the
one was, That he only Baniſh'd <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> and had not cut off his

ſo, though it be not likely; And if he were not Guilty of ſuch a Crime, he
ought not to have been put to Death: for a Throne cannot be Eſtabliſhed by

                  <p>Againſt <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, one of the Articles

immediately holden of God, after he had obtained divers Acts for his own
particular Ends, he obtained Bulls &amp; heavy Cenſures from <hi>Rome</hi> to
obſerve and perform them, contrary to the Honour and ancient Privilege of
this Kingdom; whereby appears, That even in a time of Popery the
Aſſiſtance of the Pope and Biſhops which were included in it, was ſo
far from being a Protection to the King, that it was Deſtructive to him; much
more is the Aſſiſtance of Biſhops likely to be Deſtructive, rather
than a Safety in a time of Proteſtancy. The Biſhop likewiſe Concurr'd
with the reſt, and accuſed him, That he had taken Money, Jewels and Plate

<hi>Mengus Flagell. Daemon. p.</hi> 36. The Exorciſt ties a Stole about the
Neck of the Party with three knots, ſaying, <hi>Oh ye Abominable and
Rebellious Spirits, I Adjure, Conjure and Compell you, whereſoever you have
your Reſidence in this man, by the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,
that ye immediately underſtand the words of my Conjuration, and the virtue of
it, and that ye dare not depart from the Creature of God, and Image of
Chriſt, without my Licence.</hi> This is not only Anti-Proteſtant, and the
way to bring in all the Popiſh Magick and Exorciſms into the Church; but is
Anti-Chriſtian, for Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affirms, There is no holier or higher
way of caſting out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil than by Faſting and Prayer, as appears,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 17.14. <hi>And when they were come to the multitude, there came
to him a certain man kneeling down to him, and ſaying, Lord have mercy on my

fire, and oft into the water. And I brought him to thy Diſciples, and they
could not cure him.</hi> And <hi>verſe</hi> 18. <hi>And Jeſus rebuked the
Devil, and he departed out of him: and the Child was cured from that very hour.
Then came the Diſciples to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus apart, and ſaid, Why could not we
caſt him out? And Jeſus ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Becauſe of your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief:
for verily I ſay unto you, if ye have Faith, as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed,

Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by Prayer and Faſting.</hi> Chriſt
agian will not ſuffer the Diſciples to prohibit any to caſt out the

Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out Devils in thy Name, and we forbad him,
becauſe he followed not us. But Jeſus ſaid, Forbid him not for there is
no man that ſhall do a Miracle in my Name, that can lightly ſpeak Evil of
me. For he that is not againſt us, is on our part.</hi> The Biſhops Canon
appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore clean contrary to the Example and Precept of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is before mention'd, how the Bodies of Dead Perſons in
their Graves are by ſome believed to be Revived and Tormented by the Devil;
and how Locuſts, Flies and Fiſhes have been ſtruck with this Thunderbolt
of Excommunication. There is no Good man dare Torment or Deſtroy by the help
of any Inviſible Spirit, nor will, nor ought any good Magiſtrate ſuffer
them, without a Sign of Miſſion from God, above the Power of his Temporal
Sword; for all Magicians and Witches would then Act their Miſchiefs under
pretence that they do it by the Spirit of God; and that their Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the Curſe of God. If therefore any Malefice follow without a Sign of
Miſſion, whereby they had a Warrant to Curſe, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Sign of
Miſſion, whereby they had a Warrant to Curſe, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ought to
puniſh them for Witchcraft, or all Laws againſt Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft muſt be
Repealed, and the Devil let looſe, by his Inſtruments the Witches, to do
what miſchief he pleaſes, and no Judg preſume to puniſh a Witch, if he
only ſay, What he did was done by the Spirit of God. It is impoſſible to
diſtinguiſh inviſible Spirits, or to trie the Spirit, whether God or the
Devil, but by viſible Sign; if the hurt be done therefore by any Perſon, by
aſſiſtance of a Spirit, unleſs he ſhew a Sign, he ought, by the
ſtanding Laws and Acts of Parliament, to be puniſhed for Witchcraft; and if
he pretend to have a Miſſion from the Spirit of God, and hath none, he
ought to be puniſhed for a Cheat. And under the ſame <hi>Dilemma</hi> fall
the Authors and Executors of the before mention'd Canon, prohibiting
Miniſters to caſt out the Devil by Faſting, and muſt be guilty either
of Withcraft or a Cheat, if they cannot ſhew a Sign of Miſſion to make
ſuch a prohibition, and to give ſuch a Licence as their Canon imports,
though they impute the ſame to the Miniſters who Faſt and Pray, when they
do not.</p>

That Excommunications, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions and Interdicts, were only inventions to
maintain the Biſhops Pride and Covetouſneſs; and that they were Murderers
who deliver'd over to the Lay-power: The ſame held <hi>John Hus</hi> and
<hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> who were therefore Martyr'd by the
Papiſts; <hi>Luther</hi> likewiſe oppoſed Excommunication; and
<hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and many other Learned men, have ſufficiently proved the
impoſture of it, and that it never came from <pb n="387" facs="tcp:49347:206"/>Chriſt,
but the true Original from whence it came, appears in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples following:
<hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the old Superſtitious Law-giver of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
had his Law (or he feigned) from his Nymph, or She-Devil <hi>Egeria,</hi>
firſt inſtituted his <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> or High-Prieſt, which name
the Pope hath ſince aſſumed to himſelf, and gave him Power over all
Sacrifices and Ceremonies, to make propitious their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial, and
eſpecially to appeaſe the <hi>Manes</hi> and infernal Gods, under whoſe
Power they believed the Souls lay after Death, and made their Superſtitious
Followers to believe, That the Prieſts, who were Maſters of theſe
Ceremonies, could ſend their Souls to Heaven or Hell, as they pleaſed,
according to <hi>Virgil,</hi>

of Proteſtants are Diſſentients in Conſcience to divers Doctrines of
the 39. Articles, and therefore Subſcription to the ſame is no true Teſt,
nor ought to be Impoſed on them. (1.) Becauſe theſe 39. Articles were
made by the Biſhops, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. in the Fourth Year of the Reign of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> while the Papiſt Peers were yet in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and
in Power, who with the Biſhops in their Front, were too hard for her, and of

                  <p>She was not able to perfect Reformation at one Stroke. (2.)
Becauſe in theſe Articles Biſhops preſumed to be Legiſlators, Judges
and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners in their own Caſe, for the Biſhops make the Article 36.
whereby they Conſtitute themſelves Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops; and
Article 32. <pb n="394" facs="tcp:49347:210"/>They Declare it lawful for all men to Marry;
Article 34. They Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly make Traditions of the Church to be
Changeable, according to Diverſity of Countries, Times, and mens Manners;
ſo before they come to their Ceremonial Law, they ſet up their Legend-Law,
and the Ceremonies muſt be Founded on what Legends they pleaſe, and no man
muſt oppoſe either Tradition, or Legend, or Ceremonies ſet up by Common
Authority, that is, by Authority of the Biſhops (for the Houſe of Commons
never Authorized them) <hi>Rog. Art.</hi> 34. <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi>
196. Then, Article 33. they Order Excommunication, Delivery to Satan, Penance,

<hi>Anno</hi> 1603. They aſſume the Legiſlative Power to make Canons and
Conſtitutions Eccleſiaſtical, without the aſſent of the Houſe of
Commons; they Order Saying or Singing of Common-Prayer and the Letany, with all
the Ceremonies preſcribed by the <hi>Can.</hi> 14, 15. Copes, Surplices and
Hoods to be wom in Cathedrals, by <hi>Can.</hi> 17, 27. Marriage not to be
without Banns or Licenſe. <hi>Can.</hi> 62. None to deliver from Satan
without the Biſhops Licenſe. <hi>Can.</hi> 72. And no Miniſter to Preach,
Read Lecture, or Catechize, without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the 39. Articles.
<hi>Can.</hi> 36, 37. And then to make clear work, they Order, That if any

Biſhops, to be in any part Erroneous, or ſuch as he may not with a good
Conſcience Subſcribe to, let him be Excommunicate <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi>
which is without Summons or Hearing. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. <hi>Can.</hi> 9. So,
unleſs the Proteſtant-Miniſter will Popiſhly acknowledg the Biſhop to
be Infallible and without Error, and that all his Traditions and Ceremonies of
Worſhip, of Marriage, and the like, Ordained by Epiſcopal Authority are, of
Divine Right to oblige the Conſcience; and that he neither can Teach, nor
Faſt, nor Pray, though to deliver from the Devil, without his Licenſe; Here
is a Teſt wherein the Biſhop aſſumes to be Legiſlator, Judg, an

ſo infinite and unlimited an Extent in the Letter, that there is
neceſſity of limiting them in the intention, which intention being Implicit
only, and not Expreſs, may be made ſo various by Expoſitors, that the
ſame likewiſe is infinitely ambiguous and unintelligible; and that Pious
Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> being at her firſt Entry to the Kingdom, as good as
under the Wardſhips of Biſhops, could not avoid the Forming of this Oath of
Supremacy by them, on the firſt Act and Year of her Reign, and to impoſe
the ſame on the Subjects; not for her Benefit, but their own, though after
finding the ſame ſo general, obſcure, and wreſted by falſe
Interpretations, ſhe endeavour'd by a ſubſequent Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
publiſhed, to have explained and limited the ſame, according to her true
intention and meaning; but the ſame being not done by Act of Parliament,
proved not ſufficient to relieve many doubtful and wounded Conſciences
amongſt the People; of which <hi>vide</hi> more at large before, <hi>p.</hi>
167, 168.</p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:49347:211"/>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The words <hi>[Supreme Governor,]</hi> include both
the Legiſlative, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial and Executive Power,<note place="margin">The words
<hi>[only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme]</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</note> and the word
<hi>[only]</hi> excludes literally the Parliament from having any Vote in
either; whereas the known Law of the Land is, That no Law can be Enacted to
bind the People, without the mutual Aſſent of the King, and their lawful
Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Parliament; and that no Contract of Supreme Government can
be made, without the Aſſent of two Parties at leaſt, and not one
only.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) The words <hi>[only Supreme Governor in all
Spiritual things,]</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Letter, include the Papal Power of
Diſpenſation with the Law of God, of Receiving Confeſſions of Sins,
Impoſing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Excommunication, Abſolution, and Pardon of Sins, which
are Powers only belonging to God in Perſon, and ought not to be Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
or Exerciſed by Angels, Saints, Daemons or Men.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) The ſame words include Supreme Power over the
Souls and Conſciences of men, which is a Power belonging only to God in
Perſon, and ought not to be Aſſumed by Angels, Saints, Daemons or
Men.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) When all this Supremacy in Spiritual things is
congeſted into an Oath, and the Flowers inſeparable from the Celeſtial
Crown pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly attempted to be torn thence, and annexed to a
Temporal, what is the Deſign and Effect of it, but that the Biſhop Robs
both God and the King of the Supremacy pretended to both, but intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
neither? for where will the Biſhop permit the Temporal Prince to diſpenſe
with the Law of God, to Receive Confeſſion of Sins, to Impoſe Penance, to
Excommunicate, to give Abſolution and Pardon of Sins, but he will command him
to deſiſt, or, what is worſe, with his Temporal Sword to beat the Buſh,
that the Biſhop may catch the Bird, or with his <hi>Excommunicato
Capiendo,</hi> and <hi>Heretico Comburendo,</hi> to catch and roaſt the Bird
himſelf for the Biſhop to eat it; and of the ſubtlety of the Biſhop, as
to this matter, ſee more before, <hi>p.</hi> 167, 168, 169. How little
incouragement there is therefore, for Proteſtants to take this Oath of
Supremacy, wherein the Kings name is only abuſed, and made a Stale, to draw a
Supreme and Arbitrary Power to Biſhops, both over the King and them, and to
drein the Royal Treaſury into their own Pockets; and how untrue a Teſt
ſuch an Oath muſt be, is humbly ſubmitted to Supreme Authority.</p>

Delegacies of Marriage, Legitimation, and all other matters which Popes have
formerly granted from <hi>Rome</hi> to Kings and their Subjects at

a Supreme Prince; no Delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but from a Superior to an Inferior; for the
Pope is Superior to his Legate, though he be <hi>Legatus à Latere;</hi>
and the higheſt preferment this Popiſh Act of Parliament allows the King,
is, to be the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Legate; then the Act having made him Supreme to
the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Law, and King, gives him as high Supremacy over the
Judicial Power in all Courts, as well Spiritual as Temporal, which is,
Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over the Parliament, which is a Court-Temporal. This Act therefore
doth ſet up more than Prelacy or Arch-Prelacy at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for
that was there before, and the Gyants had piled up <hi>Pelion</hi> on

if they ſet not on the Gyants head the Triple Crown, 'tis ſure they have

over the Marriage, not only of the old Palm Trees, and Legitimations of the

permitted to Grand Juries, when it doth not appear to them whether the Bill is

                  <p>It ſeems not:</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe to Plant Religion by Penalty, is to Plant
it by the Sword, whereof Chriſt gave neither Precept nor Example, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Prohibition Implicit in his Expreſs Command to <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi>
26.52. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Put up again thy Sword into his place:

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49347:214"/>though it prohibit not lawful Defence to thoſe who have
the Power of the Sword, which <hi>Peter</hi> had not; yet it prohibits unlawful
Invaſions; amongſt all which, that of Conſcience is the greateſt, with
a Denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ill Succeſs ſhall follow, ſufficiently verified in
the many Examples of Emperors and Princes, when they went to make War againſt
ſuch as Defended their Conſcience.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) To Plant Religion by the Sword, is a Relapſe to
Popery, and we commit that Crime our ſelves, which we impute to be the
higheſt in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Error in Conſcience is not in the Power of the
Party to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; it is unjuſt therefore to Impoſe a Penalty for what
was not in the Parties Power to prevent before, or amend after.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Thoughts ought not to be puniſh'd by men before
they break into External Acts or at leaſt diſcover themſelves by Words or
Deeds to External Witneſſes.</p>

given the Conſciences of Foreign Proteſtants againſt Foreign Papiſts,
by how much the more merciful the dealing is of the Native Proteſtants here,
towards the Conſciences of their Native Papiſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) If a Teſt is made Penal it ceaſes to be a

more than this, That the Penal Acts againſt Recuſancy and Non-Conformity

advance a Publique free Worſhip, according to ſuch Form and Ceremonies as

his followers to Fight with, Kill and Slay ſuch Unbelievers, and take their
Goods and Lands from them, wherever they can find them; he Commandeth them to
bring a ſhare of the Spoils to the Prophet, meaning himſelf, and ſaith
further, <hi>Alc. cap.</hi> 61. <hi>God loveth thoſe who Fight in Rank and
File for his Law.</hi> And what other Doctrine and Practice do Popes and
Biſhops Preach and Act, but the ſame, which ſhall take the Spoil of the
miſerable People they get under their Power, for no other Crime but their
Conſcience; for this they contend one with another, and offer Force to
deſtroy the Conſcience it ſelf, and Body and Soul with it, ſo they may
Seiſe their Prey of Goods and Lands, as <hi>Jezabel</hi> did of
<hi>Naboth,</hi> 1 Kings 21.8. <hi>So ſhe wrote Letters in</hi> Ahab's
<hi>name, and Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with his Seal, and ſent the Letters unto the
Elders and Nobles that were in his City, dwelling with</hi> Naboth. <hi>And
ſhe wrote in the Letters, ſaying, Proclaim a Faſt, and ſet</hi> Naboth
<hi>on high among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſet two men, Sons of</hi> Belial
<hi>before him, to bear witneſs againſt him, ſaying, Thou did'ſt
Blaſpheme God and the King. And the men of his City, even the Elders, and the
Nobles, who were the Inhabitants in his City, did as</hi> Jezabel <hi>had
ſent unto them: They Proclaimed a Faſt, and ſet</hi> Naboth <hi>on high
among the People. And there came in two men, Children of</hi> Belial, <hi>and
ſate before him: and the men of</hi> Belial <hi>witneſſed againſt him,
even againſt</hi> Naboth, <hi>in the preſence of the People, ſaying,</hi>
Naboth <hi>did Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God and the King. Then they carried him Forth out
of the City, and ſtoned him with ſtones, that he Died.</hi> Whence is to be
Noted, (1.) That the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> imitates <hi>Jezabel,</hi> in
ſending Letters in the Kings name; for ſo are all <hi>Excommunicato
Capiendo's,</hi> and <hi>Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico <pb n="405" facs="tcp:49347:215"/>Comburendo's</hi> in
the name of the King in whoſe Dominions they are Granted, and Sealed with his
Seal. (2.) <hi>Jezabel</hi> pretended Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Proclaimed a Faſt, and
accuſed of Blaſphemy; ſo do the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Whore pretend
Religion wholly and ſolely in thoſe Writs. (3.) In this they are worſe
than <hi>Jezabel,</hi> for ſhe accuſed only of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, which is an
External Act, and if there had been any ſuch thing, it had been poſſible
to have been witneſſed, but theſe puniſh and deſtroy for Internal
Thoughts and Conſcience. (4.) <hi>Jezabel</hi> accuſed of Actual
Blaſphemy againſt God, which is <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> and againſt the
Moral Law; and though <hi>Ahab</hi> and ſhe were both Idolaters, yet did not
accuſe <hi>Naboth;</hi> That he was a Recuſant or Non-Conformiſt to come
to the Temple of their Idol, or to join in their Common-Prayer before it, or
would not bow to their Altar, or obſerve their Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; nor do we find
amongſt all the Idolatries amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that any was
compell'd by Force to Worſhip them, neither could there have been Seven
Thouſand who had not bowed the Knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> had there been Penal
Statutes againſt Recuſancy or Non-Conformity; but the now Maſters of
Ceremonies are worſe than <hi>Jezabel,</hi> who deſtroy men unleſs they
will break the Moral Law, bow to Idols and Altars, and obey the Ceremonial Law
of men above the Moral Law of God.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) That the ſole end of Compulſion to Forms of
Worſhip or Confeſſion of Faith, is to get Money, and not the Glory of
God. Take theſe farther Examples, in the Primitive times, <hi>Anno</hi> 346.
<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtathius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sebaſtia,</hi> a man of great reputed
Integrity and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, being a Diſſentient from the common
practice of other Biſhops, abſented himſelf from the Publick Conventions,
where things were practiſed againſt his Conſcience; and kept Meetings in
Private Houſes, Preacht and Adminiſtred the Sacrament, not in the places
and manner appointed by the other Biſhops Cannons; they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their
Gainful Canons and Orders like to be laid aſide, Conſpired together at the
Council of <hi>Gangra</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> making ſevere Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of
their own, and likewiſe pretending Apoſtolical Canons againſt all
Biſhops or Presbyters (for ſo were they called) which ſhould be
Non-Conformiſts, that they ſhould be Excommunicated and Depoſed, not
regarding though to Acts againſt their Conſciences, and not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by
the Moral Law of God; but though this Corruption crept in, even in the
Primitive times, amongſt thoſe who called themſelves Chriſtians, and
the miſery of Iniquity did then begin to work, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7.
<hi>And there were then many Anti-Chriſts,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. Yet no
Example or Precept could they pretend from Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, 
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:49347:216"/>for theſe Anti-Chriſtian and Anti-Apoſtolical
Canons, Coin'd to get Money, and Compulſory to Conſciences, either to
deſtroy themſelves by Acting contrary to their own Light, or openly to
accuſe themſelves, to be deſtroyed by others; where did Chriſt (who
aboliſhed all Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonials, and Declared the Worſhip of God to be in Spirit
and Truth) make ſo much as one Canon againſt Recuſancy to Pray in
Temples, or Non-Conformity to Prayer in Forms? Where did Chriſt or his
Apoſtles make one Law or Canon Compulſory to the Conſcience in Form of
Worſhip, or with the Penalties of Confiſcation, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication hanging
at the tail of it? where did they ever make ſo much as one ſuch Canon of
<hi>Marriage,</hi> the matter now in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie? or, where did Chriſt,
or any Apoſtle of Chriſt, ſo much as Marry one Couple, or give Authority
to any Prieſt to do it, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Fees for the doing? who would never
make Canons to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the Conſcience to that, or any thing elſe, were it
not to get Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> who paſſes for a Father of the
Church, getting to be Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria, Anno Dom.</hi> 4.18. turn'd
out all the Novatians out of their Churches there, they being Non-Conformiſts
to his; and the chief matter objected againſt them, was, They were againſt
Biſhops, which might have ſatisfied a Succeſſor of Chriſt, who
pretended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lay up Treaſure in Heaven, where neither Moth nor Ruſt
doth Corrupt; but he Rifled all the Treaſure from thoſe Churches, and from
their Biſhop or Presbyter all the Subſtance he had, and like a new Broom
ſwept all clean into his own Coffers, <hi>Socrat. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi>
7. How far different from the Example of Chriſt, who though he whipt the
Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple, and overthrew the Tables of the
Money-Changers, took not one Penny of the Money; but Biſhop <hi>Cyrill</hi>
aim'd at the Monopoly of the Trade to himſelf here on Earth, and left the
Treaſure in Heaven to Chriſt. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> a City in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> was a great Scourge to
Non-Conformiſts, whom he called Hereticks, but he perſecuted them not out
of Zeal, but Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs to wring Money from them; wherefore to that end
there was no Device but he practiſed; and to afflict them the more, he put
them in Fetters to hold up their hands at the Bar, <hi>Socrat. lib.</hi> 7.
<hi>cap.</hi> 3. But while <hi>Theodoſius</hi> went to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to obtain greater Power yet to Squeez
Diſſentients and Non-Conformiſts, and particularly thoſe who were
againſt the Faith of one Subſtance; and had above all other Perſecuted
<hi>Agapetus</hi> a Biſhop of a contrary Faith; <hi>Agapetus</hi> in his
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to gain his Enemies Biſhoprick from him, turn'd to be of the
ſame Faith with his Enemy, and acknowledged one Subſtance of the Father and
Son, and who before was an <hi>Homoiouſiaſt,</hi> became now an 
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:49347:216"/>
                     <hi>Homouſiaſt,</hi> and obtain'd thereby the
Government of the Dioceſs, Churches, and City of <hi>Synada;</hi> ſhortly
after, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> return'd home from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to
<hi>Synada,</hi> and brought with him the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Lieutenant,
whereof he bragged not a little, that he had enough to Pepper the men to the
purpoſe, who were not of one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with him; and being Ignorant of all
the things which were done in his Abſence, he ſtraight way went to the
Church, where he found but ſmall welcome, for the Doors were made faſt
againſt him; and after he knew their Dealing, again he poſteth to
<hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> there he bewail'd his State to <hi>Atticus</hi> the
Biſhop, and open'd unto him, That he was Injuriouſly Thruſt from his
Biſhoprick; <hi>Atticus</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that all fell out for the Profit
of the Church of God, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to pacifie him with mild and courteous
Language, Exhorting him to embrace a quiet Life void of Trouble and
Moleſtation, and not to prefer his own Gain and private Lucre above the
Publick Profit and Peace of the Church; and thereon writ to <hi>Agapetus,</hi>
willing him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Biſhoprick, and not to fear at all the
Diſpleaſure of <hi>Theodoſius, Id ib.</hi> By which appears, though
Biſhops call themſelves Angels and Meſſengers of God, yet are they not
like them, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. <hi>There is joy in the
preſence of the Angels of God, over one Sinner that Repenteth.</hi> Nor
though they call themſelves Shepherd; of the Flock, are they like the good
Shepherd of whom Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.12. <hi>If a man have
an Hundred Sheep, and one of them be gone aſtray, doth he not leave the
Ninety and Nine, and goeth into the Mountains and ſeeketh that which is gone
aſtray? And if ſo be that he find it, Verily I ſay unto you, he rejoiceth
more of that Sheep, than of the Ninety and Nine which went not aſtray.</hi>
Nor like Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 8.50. <hi>I ſeek not my own
Glory.</hi> Nor like <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. <hi>I
ſeek not yours, but you.</hi> And <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Here have we no
continuing City, but we ſeek one to come.</hi> Nor like thoſe he ſaith
died in the Faith, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Not having received the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſuaded of them, and
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, them and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and Pilgrims on
the Earth. For they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek
a Countrey. And truly if they had been mindful of that Countrey, from whence
they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned: But now they
deſire a better Countrey, that is, an Heavenly.</hi> None of which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
would the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> or <hi>Syadan</hi> Biſhop, nor many others
follow; nor do they with their Penal Teſts, Forms and Ceremonies, Perſecute
to Convert, but to Pervert; and to that end form their Teſts, Oaths and
Ceremonies, as contrary to Senſe, Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:49347:217"/>as they can poſſible; and as numerous as they are in
the 39. Articles, that they may have all either under blind obedience, and take
Arbitrarily from them what they pleaſe, or if they will not Renounce their
Senſe, Reaſon and Conſcience, they may have a pretence to Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them
of their Goods; and a Terrible Diſappointment it would be to Biſhops and
their Chaplains, if all Miniſters ſhould have turn'd Conformiſts to their
Faith, Oaths, Subſcriptions and Ceremonies, for then would all Pluralities
have been ſupplied with ſingle Incumbents Reſidents on the Places, and
perhaps the greater part of the Biſhopricks and Benefices, with men more
above Exception than many of the Poſſeſſors may be; and there might
have been many <hi>Peters</hi> in the Church, yet not a <hi>Simon</hi> found
amongſt them.</p>
                  <p n="9">(9.) There ought to be no Compulſion uſed to
Papiſts to Pray in a Temple, becauſe it is already proved to be Prohibited
by Chriſt, for any to Pray in a Temple or publick Place, except the Parties
are agreed.</p>
                  <p n="10">(10.) It is a Compulſion many times of a doubtful
Conſcience, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Sin or Damnation, as ſome have doubted,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. or Martyrdom, or Hypocriſie, to ſave their Lives or
Goods.</p>
                  <p n="11">(11.) It is as great a mockery of God, to force men to
play the Hypocrites in Ceremonies or Prayers, againſt their Conſciences, in
a place of Publick Convention, as to drive Horſes and other Cattle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
Church at the time of Prayer there; and as <hi>Banks</hi> did his Horſe, make
them fall on their Knees, and Worſhip the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="12">(12.) Compulſion of Papiſts or Proteſtants to
Forms of Common-Prayer, deprives them of the Benefit of being taught the
Goſpel, by Reaſon that no diſtinction of the place and time of Prayer and
Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is made, according to the Examples and Precepts of Chriſt,
alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn; for all the Common-Prayer being Formed by Popes or Biſhops,
is chopt into ſo many pieces of Prayers, Chapters, Leſſons, Reſponds,
Letanies, Pſalms, pieces of Epiſtles, pieces of Goſpels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as Confound both Method and Memory; and thereby, while the People endeavour to
Pray and Learn both at once, they can do neither effectually.</p>
                  <p n="13">(13.) Compulſion to Common-Prayer deprives both
Papiſt &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant of the Benefit of either Reading, or Hearing the
Scripture Read. (1.) Becauſe it is Read in ſuch a mangled immethodical way,
neither according to the Contexture of the Hiſtory, nor according to the
Titles of a <hi>Concordance</hi> or <hi>Polyanthy,</hi> but both Examples and
Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts broken off confuſedly from what preceded or followed them, whereby
they are made unintelligible, and not again joined with ſuch 
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:49347:217"/>of one another, as ſhould mutually expound them, and
both Prayers and Pſalms are Read in ſuch a Canting Note in Cathedrals, as
they are not intelligible; ſo, as there is no human Author, Art or Science
Read or Taught ſo confuſedly, immethodically and Cantingly, as the
Scripture, whereby ſuch as cannot Read themſelves, never hear the ſame
Read in any Edifying way their whole Lives, which is done only on deſign of
gain, to make more Diſſentient Miniſters, and fewer of the Trade. (2.)
Thoſe who are able to Read themſelves, are thereby deprived of the Reading
the ſame at their Homes; the Papiſts by their own Prieſts being not
ſuffer'd to have an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible in their Houſes, and the
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>England</hi> being not ſuffer'd by their Prieſts to
keep themſelves at their Houſes; whereas in <hi>Holland</hi> many Devout
&amp; Pious Proteſtants never go to Churches to hear the Scripture Read, but
Read the ſame on <hi>Sundays</hi> at home at their own Houſes, and are far
more ready and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and more Pious in practice of the ſame, than thoſe
that do Repair to the Publick Reading; neither is there any man Compell'd to
Church or Chappel there, but may if they deſire, follow the Precept of
Chriſt, to Read or Pray privately in their Cloſet; and the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the
Primitive Chriſtians, amongſt whom there was not a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Altar for
neer 300 Years after Chriſt, till <hi>Conſtantine</hi> corrupted them to
ſet up Cathedrals. (3.) Many things in the Common-Prayer being offenſive to
many Conſciences, I diſpute not whether weak or ſtrong, or whether they
are offences given or taken, but being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to many, ſuch as are
offended, and who would gladly come to the Church to hear the Scripture Read by
it ſelf, or Expounded in an Expoſition, or Lecture, or Sermon, if the
ſame were done as Chriſt always uſed to do it, in a Synagogue, without
Prayer mixt with it (the Reaſons whereof are ſufficiently before ſhew,

Common-Prayer, whether ſingle, or mixt, they loſe the hearing of Scripture
Read, becauſe they ſhall be forced to hear ſuch Prayers as offend them
Read or mixt with it; &amp; as long as they are compell'd, how can it be
expected, but the number of Non-Conformiſts will be far greater than

                     <note place="margin">Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Prayer before

and Proteſtant of the Benefit of hearing the Scripture Read in the
Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contexture and Order, wherein it was left written; ſo the
Prayer before Sermon deprives them of the Benefit of hearing the Scripture
Expounded, either in that Method and Order it was left written, or in any other
Order or Method appointed by the King and Parliament, of ſuch matters as are
neceſſary to Salvation, and tend moſt to the Peace <pb n="410" facs="tcp:49347:218"/>of the Church; for unleſs there were an Interval for the Bell to
Toll a ſpace after the end of the Prayer, before the beginning of the

the Sermon begins, and very many of them, though they would be all glad to join
with the Chaplain in his Prayer for the King, yet will they many of them
perhaps have Scruples in Conſcience to join with him in Prayer for his
Patron.<note place="margin">Patron if to be Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in Publick.</note> (1.)
Becauſe he may ſometimes happen to be a Papiſt, and one that ſeeks the

Perſons, we are directed by the Scripture to Pray in Publick for none but

Excluded from all publick Authority and Office, therefore no publick Perſon.
(3.) As to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perſons, the Scripture and practice of the Primitive
Chriſtians di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to Pray for no private Perſons particularly, and by

Caſe, the direction of Chriſt, and practice of the Primitive Church, was,
to caſt him out by Faſting and Prayer; but many Patrons are neither ſick
nor poſſeſs'd, therefore there is no direction in Scripture for them to
be Prayed for by name in publick. (4.) The Chaplain uſeth to Pray for
Biſhops, eſpecially if Patrons, wherein many Proteſtants may not be free

from the greateſt part of the World. What a work is here, who ſhould Judg

neither will it be poſſible to be taken out of the Wrong, nor did any of

aſſumed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, according to the Four firſt General Councils, if
it make them ſuſpect to be Papiſts, and not ſit to be Prayed for in
Publick.</head>
                  <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Coke</hi> ſays this Parliament 1.
<hi>Eliz:</hi> 1. was doubtful what they ought to determine Hereſie and
Schiſm, and what not, which was as much as the Biſhops needed to deſire,
that the Layity might be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and they have Power to keep them ſo, and
Hereſie a Quaere to be Judged by themſelves, <hi>pro Arbitrario.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) It appears that the Pious Queen, the Dawning of the
Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but newly entring with her, ſhe could not ſuddenly Diſpell
the Darkneſs yet hanging over her own Proteſtant Party, nor the Blacker
Clouds gathering from Foreign and Native Papiſts againſt her, nor
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her own Biſhops deſigning to continue thoſe Privileges of
Profit, tranſlated by—from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Canterbury;</hi> for
certainly if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Party had underſtood, That the Four firſt
Councils had adjudged all thoſe to be Hereticks who would not Worſhip
Images, and had been able to have over-Voted the Popiſh Party and Biſhops,
they would never have given them Power to Judg Hereſie according to thoſe
Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Councils, for thereby they might Sentence them and all
Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants that were againſt Images, to the Stake.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) The Bible was but little before Tranſlated into
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet to keep it more dark ſtill, than if it had continued
in <hi>Latine,</hi> they who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves Proteſtant-Biſhops,
ſent the People to Learn the <pb n="414" facs="tcp:49347:220"/>ſame of <hi>Greek</hi>
Councils, and to Read there the Law of Hereſie, while they Judged them at
home in their <hi>Latine</hi>-Law and <hi>Latine</hi>-Courts the mean
while.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) They equal Councils with Canonical Scriptures, that
their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and Provincial Synods may have the ſame Authority.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) They equal their Convocation with the King and
Parliament; for the words of the Statute are, <hi>or Determined to be Hereſie
by High Court of Parliament of this Realm, with the Aſſent of the Clergy in
their Convocation:</hi> Knowing if the Miter once get equal, 'tis but one
ſtep more to be above the Crown.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) By thoſe words they Conſtitute to themſelves
the Power of a Negative in Legiſlation, againſt the King in Parliament, and
the two other Eſtates, which makes them a Fourth Eſtate in the
Legiſlative Power, knowing, ſuch Fourth Eſtate, like the Fourth Beaſt
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> may eaſily Devour all the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) They Judg, ſince no Commiſſioners were made,
every Biſhop in his Dioceſs a Judg of Hereſie <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and
they by their own Popiſh Canons and the old Popiſh Acts againſt
<hi>Lollards,</hi> who were the followers of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and the
Primitive Proteſtants, and the Proto-Martyrs of <hi>England,</hi> Judged
Proteſtancy to be <hi>Lollary</hi> and Hereſie; and all the Sheriffs of
<hi>England</hi> take an Oath with all their Power, to Deſtroy all Hereſies
and Errors, commonly call'd <hi>Lollaries,</hi> which is Proteſtancy, and to
aſſiſt the Biſhops in the ſame, whenſoever by them Required,
whereby they have the whole Military Power at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to Judg and
Deſtroy Proteſtants as Hereticks.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) They Judg Hereſie by their own Ceremonial Laws
and Canons, whereby they Arrogate a Power above the Moral Law of God, by which
alone all Hereſies and Schiſms, and all Error and Truth ought to be
Judged.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, That ſuch Biſhops, if there are any
ſuch, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all theſe ways of Popery, many Proteſtants may
happen to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them to be Papiſts for their profit, and therefore
ſcruple to join with their Chaplains in their Prayer before Sermon, for God
to ſpeed them.</p>
                  <p>It will not agree with the Conſciences of many
Proteſtants, to join with the Chaplain in publick Prayer for his Patron, (1.)
Becauſe all Patronages were invented and erected by the Pope and Papal
Laws,<note place="margin">all Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age came from the Pope.</note> and the
Strength and Riches of all Popery conſiſts in Patronages, or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of
Preſentation to Cathedral, Collegiat, Parochial, or other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Churches
or Houſes. (2.) It is very unjuſt, that any who muſt pay the Lawyer or
Phyſician his Fees, ſhould not have Election of <pb n="415" facs="tcp:49347:220"/>ſuch a one of either, as he can Truſt; and much more as to a
Divine Lawyer, and Phyſician of his Soul, that any ſhould be Impoſed on
him whom he cannot Truſt, and who may perhaps Poiſon him in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
it ſelf, of which Examples have been already Cited; but the Chaplain who
Prays for the Patron, is obtruded on the Pay of the Pariſh without their
Aſſent, and the Patron many times pays him not a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but Sells to him
his Preſentation, and Exacts ſo great a Sum for it, as brings him in Debt
as long as he Lives, which makes him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prey on the Flock, then Pray for
it, and to be in perpetual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, rather than Peace. (3.) Admit the
Pariſh ſhould happen to be all Poor, and the Patron by Depopulation,
Impropriation, Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Commons, and other Oppreſſion, Gets all, and
Pays all; yet it is juſt the Pariſh ſhould Elect their Miniſter, and
not he; for Chriſt ſends it as Glad Tidings to <hi>John, Matth.</hi> 11.5.
<hi>The Poor have the Goſpel Preached to them,</hi> and ſaith nothing of
the Rich, Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth all his Bleſſings on the Poor,
<hi>Luke</hi> 6.20. <hi>Bleſſed be ye Poor: for yours is the Kingdom of
God. Bleſſed are ye that hunger now: for ye ſhall be filled. Bleſſed
are ye that weep now: for ye ſhall laugh.</hi> And <hi>James</hi> 2.5.
<hi>Hath not God choſen the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, and Heirs of
the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed them that love him?</hi> Dan. 4.27.
<hi>Wherefore, O King, let my Counſel be acceptable unto thee, and break off
thy ſins by Righteouſneſs, and thine Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the
Poor.</hi> Prov. 29.14. <hi>The King that faithfully Judgeth the Poor, his
Throne ſhall be Eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> 2 Cor. 9.9. <hi>He hath given
to the Poor, his Righteouſneſs remaineth for ever.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi>
19.21. <hi>Give to the Poor, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven.</hi>
But Chriſt never pronounceth to the Rich any thing but great Dangers and
Woes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.23. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto his Diſciples;
Verily I ſay unto you, that a Rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven. And again I ſay unto you, It is eaſier for a Camel to go through
the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
Luke 6.24. <hi>Woe unto you that are Rich: for ye have received your
Conſolation. Woe unto you that are full: for ye ſhall hunger. Woe unto you
that laugh now: for ye ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> Iſa. 5.8. <hi>Woe unto
them that join Houſe to Houſe, and Field to Field.</hi> And <hi>James</hi>
5.1. <hi>Go to now ye Rich men, Weep and Howl for your Miſeries that ſhall
come upon you. Your Riches are corrupted, and your Garments moth-eaten. Your
Gold and Silver is cankred, and the ruſt of them ſhall be againſt you,
and ſhall eat your Fleſh as it were Fire.</hi> Now if the Rich ſhould
choſe the Chaplain for the Poor, he would be apt to Preach contrary to
Chriſt, totally in favour of the Rich, and not reprove but animate them in
their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions <pb n="416" facs="tcp:49347:221"/>of the Poor, which is too
notorious in the Chaplains, both of Eccleſiaſtical and Lay-Patrons;
wherefore if Patrons have more than their ſingle Votes in Election of the
Miniſter, the poor Pariſhioners may expect ſuch Law as is mention'd,
<hi>James</hi> 2.6. <hi>Do not Rich men oppreſs you, and draw you before the
Judgment-Seats?</hi> But they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſuch Goſpel as Chriſt
Preach'd, and appointed to be Preached to the Poor, nor ſuch Law as he
denounced againſt the Rich. (4.) The Chaplain in his Prayer before Sermon
tells God ſo many Lies to his Face in commendation of his Patron, that
ſurely it muſt be a meer Mockery of him, for he calls him his Grace, his
Excellency, Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, Right Worſhipful, Pious, Virtuous, and his
Very Good Lord and Patron, when ſometimes he is a Perſon of the moſt
Vile, Unworthy, Sordid and Wicked Conditions on the Earth. (5.) He gives him
more Magnificent Appellations than to God himſelf, for though he ingeminate
many times in his Prayer, Good Lord, and Good Lord, yet he never calls God my
Very Good Lord, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that Superlative Title for his Patron; the
meaneſt degree of which greateſt Divine Attribute of <hi>Good,</hi>
Chriſt himſelf (to be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Humility) refuſed, <hi>Luke</hi>
18.19. <hi>Why calleſt thou me Good? there is none Good but one, that is
God.</hi> (6.) If the Patron is ſo Very Good, Pious and Virtuous, as the
Chaplain makes him, he were more proper to aſcend the Pulpit and pray for his
Chaplain, who many times proves none of the beſt, either in Doctrine, or
Manners, but was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one who came firſt and gave moſt for the Place he
hath. (7.) He is rather an Herald hired to proclaim every <hi>Sunday</hi> in
the Year his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's empty Titles, than a Meſſenger of God to Preach on
his Divine Attributes. (8.) By theſe Paraſitical Prayers the Patron is puft
up in ſuch Pride and Folly, that he grows like the profane Lord mention'd by
<hi>Cambden,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He never needed to Pray for himſelf, he had
ſo many Prieſts to Pray for him;</hi> and the Patron and Patroneſs are
ſo fop'd with overmuch Flattery, that they ſeldom grow wiſe again as long
as they live, to diſcover thoſe Faults wherein the Prieſt leads them, and
himſelf blinded to Deſtruction, and unto the Woe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to them,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. <hi>That call Evil Good, and Good Evil, that put
Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs, that put Bitter for Sweet, and
Sweet for Bitter.</hi> (9.) As is before mention'd, amongſt the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians the Election of the Miniſter was always by the Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Congregations, till Anti-Chriſt who began to work very early, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them
of this liberty of Elections by Endowments and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages; the Patrons of
which, by this Impoſing ſuch Patriarchs, Biſhops or Presbyters as they
hired, and corrupted for their Turn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving <pb n="417" facs="tcp:49347:221"/>the
Cities and Congregations of the Free Election of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, deſtroyed

Miniſter to Parochial Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and liberty of ſecret Suffrages,
would, Firſt, deſtroy all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, for Popery cannot be without Patronages,
and the Pope as the Apex of his Supremacy, claims to be Supreme Patron of all
Catholick Churches. Secondly, This would prevent all Impoſing of
Church-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to be Miniſters to Proteſtant-Pariſhes. Thirdly, This
would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all kind of Symony, either to the Biſhop for Ordination, or
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron for Preſentation, which is impoſſible to be otherwiſe

this Evil Epiſcopal Councel to compell the People to his Confeſſion of
Faith and Forms of Worſhip, hath not only been unfortunate to
<hi>antiochus,</hi> but to all Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors who have truſted on the
Staff of ſo bruiſed a Reed as a <hi>Croſyer,</hi> on which when they have
leaned a while, in the end it will go into <pb n="419" facs="tcp:49347:222"/>their hands
and pierce them, for the Epiſcopal advice of Compulſion to Forms and
Ceremonies, makes a Rich Biſhop, but a Poor King and People; and the
Intereſt Regal and Epiſcopal, and the Law of the Crown and of the Canon
being Diametrically oppoſite one to another, it is no wonder if the Councils
of the later level always at its own Supremacy, and the Subjection of the
former; ſuch was the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Council of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of
<hi>Spain;</hi> for they Councell'd him to break his Oath to his Subjects of
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> whereby he had bound himſelf not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their ancient number of Biſhops, being but Three, to which he
notwithſtanding, contrary to his Oath, added Fourteen, which no man doubts
was highly for the Intereſt of the new Biſhops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of
<hi>Rome;</hi> but every man may ſee, was clean contrary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to the King's Intereſt; ſo they councell'd him to bring in the
Inquiſition amongſt them, to cut off the Heads of the Proteſtant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
to Maſſacre the Proteſtant People, all tending to the Advance of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Epiſcopal Tyranny, but Deſtructive to Regal Government;
and, what was the Succeſs of theſe Epiſcopal Councels, and Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of Perjury, and ſhedding of Blood; the whole Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> with
all their <hi>European</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Dominions, were thereby
diſabled to reduce ſo ſmall a Spot as the United parts of the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> and with infinite Loſſes and Diſhonour beaten
thence, and loſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ever ſince. Such Councels gave the
<hi>Romiſh,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Biſhops, to the Emperors, both in the
time of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Wars then, as likewiſe in thoſe later
Wars, both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell with Fire and
Sword the Proteſtants to the Epiſcopal Forms and Ceremonies, highly no
doubt to the Epiſcopal Intereſt, but Deſtructive to the Imperial, and
what was the Succeſs? God hath been pleaſed to make the Proteſtants
ſtronger and ſtronger, and the Emperors weaker and weaker, ever ſince
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, in whoſe time thoſe Wars began, and both he and
his Succeſſors have been ſtill compell'd, before the Wars ended, to which
they were ſet on by the Biſhops, Diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and with Loſs, to
condiſcend to a Free Exerciſe of Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is more than a
Non-Compulſion to Confelſion of Faith and Form of Worſhip, which they
might have Honourably, and before any Damage and Devaſtation to them, or
their Countrey, have Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would have been at firſt Honourably
accepted. So in the Peace concluded between the Emperor and his Diſcontented
Subjects in the Higher <hi>Hungary, Anno Dom.</hi> 1606. The firſt Article
agreed on was, <hi>That from theneforth it ſhould be lawful for every man
through the <pb n="420" facs="tcp:49347:223"/>Kingdom of</hi> Hungary, <hi>to have the free
Exerciſe of his Religion, and to believe what be would;</hi> and had not the
Emperor been miſguided by Epiſcopal Councils to the contrary, he might with
more Honour and leſs Damage to himſelf and Subjects, have prevented thoſe
Inteſtine Diſſenſions, by not taking from them that Liberty of
Conſcience, as to Faith and Form of Worſhip, which he was compell'd at
laſt to give them; it being certain that the Bordering <hi>Turk,</hi> by the
Imprudence of divers of the Emperors, in being blinded by the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Biſhops and their own, to violate the Liberty of Conſcience of thoſe
Frontier Countries, and thereby dividing and diſuniting them againſt the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, he hath thereof taken great advantages, to the great danger of
the Emperors themſelves, the Empire, and the reſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. And
how unfortunate were Epiſcopal Councils in our own Countrey, in this point of
Compulſion of the Conſcience to their Faith, Forms and Ceremonies, tending
to Epiſcopal, and not the Regal Intereſt, and how they thereby expoſed
his late Majeſty, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, Wiſe and Pious King, and his Three Kingdoms,
to an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary War; and the miſerable loſs enſued thereby, is yet
in Bleeding Memory. What Wars have been in <hi>France</hi> by Compulſion of
Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by Force, and deſtroying it by Perfidious Treacheries of
Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Councils, is likewiſe ſadly known; ſo that in all the
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Chriſtendom, Biſhops by this Compulſion to their Faith,
Forms and Ceremonies, have one time or other raiſed Civil Wars and
Diſſenſions, dangerous or deſtructive to Princes and People, and
ſhared thereby the Spoils of both; or what was a greater Prey got by our own,
made Sale of all the Eſtates of the Revenues of the Biſhopricks fallen
Twenty Years before they ever made a Sermon in their Church, or Served at their
Altar; ſo though the Wars were by themſelves occaſion'd and kindled, and
were an univerſal loſs to the People, yet they loſt nothing, and gain'd
all.</p>
                  <p>That Compulſion againſt Conſcience cauſeth Wars, doth
likewiſe agree the Learned and Pious Doctor <hi>More,</hi> who ſaith,
Denial of Liberty of Conſcience, brings upon Nations and Families Wars,
Bloodſhed, Subverſion of Families, Depoſing, Stabbing, Poiſoning of
Princes, perpetual Hatred and Enmity amongſt men, and all the Works and
Actions of the Kindom of Darkneſs; whereas if it were univerſally
acknowledged that Liberty of Religion were the Right of Mankind, all theſe
miſchiefs would be prevented, the Prince could not pretend any Quarrel
againſt the People, nor the People againſt the Prince, or againſt one
another, except for Civil Rights, which are more plain and 
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:49347:223"/>intelligible. That Compulſion to Faith, or Forms of
Worſhip, hath had the ſame Deſtructive Effects againſt the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Emperors likewiſe, which it hath had againſt the
<hi>Weſtern,</hi> appears by the Example of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Palaeologus</hi>
Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> who fearing an Invaſion from the <hi>Turks</hi>
and other Foreigners from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> endeavour'd to ſtrengthen
himſelf from the Pope, and by him with the Emperor and other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Kings from the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and by his Ambaſſadors to that end,
treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Gregory</hi> the Tenth, then Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> to Unite
and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to the <hi>Latine,</hi> and to
acknowledg the Popes Supremacy over the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and Liberty of Appeal
from them to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Emperor offer'd, and the
Pope gladly accepted of; but the People generally abhor'd theſe Proceedings
of the Emperor, and were ſo Tumultuous, that the Emperor was fain to leave
off the care of the Foreign Dangers, to look to theſe greater at home, and
told the People to quiet them, that this Alteration was made not out of any
good liking he had to it, but in reſpect of the dangerous Eſtate of things
in that juncture of Time, it behoved Prudence to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leſs Evil to
avoid the greater; for if by not granting the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Church what they
would have, they would take advantage of the Wars they had with their other
Enemies, and fall on them at the ſame time, whereby they would attain more by
force from them, than would ſatisfie them by Treaty, and not only by War
become Lords of their Religion and Ceremonies, but of all at once, their Wives,
Children, Eſtates and Lives, at the will of the Conqueror, therefore he
required them to yield to neceſſity, and not to compell him to uſe more
Severe Remedies; and not finding them pliable, ſome he Impriſon'd, ſome
Baniſh'd, ſome Confiſcated, ſome pull'd out their Eyes, ſome
Tortur'd, ſome Diſmembred, on which ſome outwardly Conformed, but not in
their hearts, but the greater part fled, ſome to <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſome to
<hi>Achaia,</hi> ſome to <hi>Peloponeſus</hi> and other Countries, and the
Emperor truſting to Foreign Forces whom he join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this and his other
Cruel Practices, in denying his Subjects Liberty of Conſcience; ſeeing they
were put to Fight, only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their own Slavery, ſo diſcouraged the
<hi>Greek</hi> Army, that the <hi>Turks</hi> overthrew them and their Emperor,
and won the day, by which they got their firſt Footing in <hi>Europe.</hi>
Whereby appears, That as Compulſion to the Faith and Ceremonies of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and denial of Liberty of Conſcience to the firſt
<hi>Arrian</hi> Chriſtians, was the cauſe of the great Conqueſts of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> who gave them Toleration in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which they could
not have of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; ſo this <pb n="422" facs="tcp:49347:224"/>denial
of Liberty of Conſcience by this <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, and his
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of his Subjects to the Ceremonies of the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> was the firſt opening an Entrance to the <hi>Turk</hi> into
<hi>Europe,</hi> and after the loſing of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire to him,
whence ſo many Fatal Miſeries have enſued to Chriſtendom.</p>
